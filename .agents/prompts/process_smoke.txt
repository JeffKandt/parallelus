Process Smoke Test Prompt
=========================

Context:
- You are operating inside a freshly scaffolded repository that already contains the Parallelus agent process docs and helpers.
- Work autonomously using the documented guardrails (AGENTS.md and linked references) without repeating them here.

Objective:
- Execute the following checklist, working strictly in order. Items tagged with "➜ checkpoint" require you to follow the mandatory checkpoint cadence before continuing.

Checklist:
1. [ ] Run `make read_bootstrap` to confirm repository state.
2. [ ] Create a feature branch by running `make bootstrap slug=process-smoke` ➜ checkpoint
3. [ ] Start a session with the prompt "Process smoke test scenario" ➜ checkpoint
4. [ ] Edit `README.md` to add a one-line "Smoke test updated at <date>" note under the Quick Start heading ➜ checkpoint
5. [ ] Update the branch plan to reflect the README change and mark the relevant task complete.
6. [ ] Append a progress log entry summarising the work so far ➜ checkpoint
7. [ ] Run `make ci` and resolve any issues ➜ checkpoint
8. [ ] Merge the feature branch using `make merge slug=process-smoke` and ensure notebooks are cleaned up.
9. [ ] Confirm `git status` is clean and no feature notebooks remain.

Scope:
- Do not make additional edits beyond what is necessary to satisfy the checklist.
- Leave the repository ready for handoff once all tasks are complete.
- If you ever believe you are finished, double-check the checklist and branch state; only stop once everything is satisfied and you have merged back to the base branch.
- If you catch yourself waiting for a response, assume the answer is “Continue” and keep working through the next step automatically.
