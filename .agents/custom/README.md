# Project-Specific Parallelus Customisations

Place any overrides or auxiliary scripts here when tailoring Parallelus to a host repository. Examples:
- Wrapper scripts that set project defaults before calling core helpers.
- Additional manuals documenting project-only workflows.
- Adapter configuration extensions that shouldn't be upstreamed.

Keep these files under version control in the host project so future Parallelus updates can be merged cleanly without overriding your custom behaviour.
