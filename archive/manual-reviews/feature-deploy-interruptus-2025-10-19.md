Decision: approved
Reviewer: codex-agent

## Findings
- Severity: Info – Verified `.agents/bin/deploy_agents_process.sh` only backs up hooks that differ from canonical scripts and skips prior `.predeploy.*.bak` copies.
- Severity: Info – Confirmed overlay deployments preserve `docs/agents/project/` and refresh only scaffold docs; senior review template now lives under `docs/agents/templates/review_report_template.md`.
- Severity: Info – Noted branch notebooks were folded into `docs/PLAN.md` and a retrospective marker/report recorded prior to merge.

## Tests & Evidence Reviewed
- `make read_bootstrap` and redeploy smoke validation in `/Users/jeff/Code/interruptus` after upgrades.
- Manual inspection of updated docs (`docs/agents/deployment.md`, `docs/reviews/README.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`).

## Follow-Ups / Tickets
