# Project Plan

## Completed Work
- Synchronous retrospective workflow enforced (marker validation, auditor prompt).
- Senior architect review guardrails updated (config defaults, review commit checks).
- Deployment safety and CI flow hardened (hook backups, Python-only adapter).

## Next Focus Areas
- Continue refining auditor heuristic coverage (e.g., additional log analysis).
- Refresh `docs/agents/project/` so it reflects the Parallelus repo (remove lingering Interruptus references) and fold any new guidance into the guardrail docs.
- Harden subagent launch permissions by codifying allowed write paths (e.g., add review-specific `allowed_writes` entries and automated verification).
