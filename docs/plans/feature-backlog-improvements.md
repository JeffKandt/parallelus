# Branch Plan â€” feature/backlog-improvements

## Objectives
- Reconstruct the canonical `docs/PROGRESS.md` so it reflects the full granular history from prior feature branches.
- Design durable guardrails to keep future progress-folding work from losing detail.

## Checklist
- [x] Aggregate branch notebooks and prior PROGRESS revisions into a timeline draft.
- [x] Restore `docs/PROGRESS.md` with the merged timeline.
- [x] Capture proposed guardrail changes (docs + automation) for review.
- [x] Decide on implementation path for the guardrail changes (hook, helper, or CI).

## Next Actions
- Socialise the new fold workflow with maintainers and confirm hook coverage meets expectations.
- Pilot the Recon queue commands (short-term vs backlog) on the next feature bootstrap and document any friction.
