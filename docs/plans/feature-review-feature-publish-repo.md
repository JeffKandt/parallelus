# Branch Plan â€” feature/review-feature-publish-repo

## Objectives
- Audit the feature publish automation and supporting tooling for regressions before merge.
- Validate tmux overlay helpers and prompt handling to ensure they do not leak control sequences into shells.
- Capture review findings and required follow-up work in progress logs for maintainers.

## Checklist
- [x] Reproduce the tmux overlay prompt leak and capture the raw escape sequence source.
- [x] Trace the overlay helper scripts/config to the misconfigured prompt string.
- [x] Implement or document the fix needed to stop injecting terminal identification data.
- [x] Update plan/progress notebooks with findings and follow-up actions.
- [ ] Summarize review outcomes for senior architect hand-off.

## Next Actions
- Decide how to resolve the CI auditor follow-ups (restore feature/publish-repo marker + notebooks, ensure audits run from that branch) and record the plan.
- Re-run targeted validation (CI + `make monitor_subagents`) to demonstrate the heartbeat fix and capture evidence for senior architect sign-off.
- Refresh `docs/agents/project/` so it no longer references the Interruptus project; add any remaining TODOs to the docs worklist.
- Harden subagent launch permissions by codifying allowed write paths (e.g., review-specific `allowed_writes` entries and automated verification).
