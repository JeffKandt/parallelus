# Branch Plan â€” feature/claude-review

## Objectives
- Allow `agents-merge` to accept post-review commits that only touch benign documentation paths.
- Regenerate notebooks so we can log follow-up work pre-merge.

## Checklist
- [x] Recreate branch plan/progress notebooks.
- [x] Implement merge guardrail tolerance for documentation-only changes.
- [x] Document the new workflow in the merge guide.
- [x] Add regression tests for the updated guardrail logic.

## Next Actions
- Rerun the senior architect review on the post-fix commit and confirm the blocker is cleared.
- Prepare merge packaging once the refreshed review is approved (fold notebooks, gather retrospectives).
- Monitor upcoming merges to ensure the benign-diff guardrail works as intended.
