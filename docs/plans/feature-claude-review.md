# Branch Plan â€” feature/claude-review

## Objectives
- Allow `agents-merge` to accept post-review commits that only touch benign documentation paths.
- Regenerate notebooks so we can log follow-up work pre-merge.

## Checklist
- [x] Recreate branch plan/progress notebooks.
- [x] Implement merge guardrail tolerance for documentation-only changes.
- [x] Document the new workflow in the merge guide.
- [x] Add regression tests for the updated guardrail logic.

## Next Actions
- Observe future merges to ensure the benign-diff gate behaves as expected.
- Re-run senior architect review on the final commit before merging.
