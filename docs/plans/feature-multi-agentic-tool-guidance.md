# Branch Plan — feature/multi-agentic-tool-guidance

## Objectives
- capture the shared “Centralizing guidance across tools” plan in a durable markdown format
- clean up the prototype directory so only the markdown source remains
- land the plan with an auditable commit for downstream coordination

## Checklist
- [ ] draft a markdown version of the guidance referenced by the ChatGPT share link
- [ ] retire the original HTML artifact once the markdown is finalised
- [ ] stage and commit the markdown plan on this branch

## Next Actions
- inspect the HTML export to identify any recoverable context and references
- draft the markdown plan with actionable sections and include the original share URL
- remove the HTML file and prepare the commit once content looks review-ready
