# Branch Plan — feature/multi-agentic-tool-guidance

## Objectives
- produce a durable, tool-agnostic implementation plan synthesising the shared “centralising guidance across tools” conversation
- define cross-agent bootstrap, override, and auditing strategy without duplicating canonical guidance
- stage the groundwork for automation/scripts that keep AGENTS.md-driven workflows deterministic

## Checklist
- [x] ingest the shared conversation and extract actionable requirements
- [x] author the implementation plan at `docs/agents/prototypes/tool-agnostic-guidance.md`
- [ ] review the plan with stakeholders and capture decisions
- [ ] identify follow-on work items (scripts, configs) and file tickets/branch plan updates

## Next Actions
- circulate the implementation plan for feedback and validation
- convert accepted tasks into tracked work items (branch plan updates or tickets)
- prepare follow-up branches for script/config implementation once scope is approved
