# Branch Plan â€” feature/context-capsule-design

## Objectives
- Capture a design proposal for a "context capsule" workflow that allows the main agent to summarize session state for subagents.
- Outline prompt scaffolding and data structures needed to deliver a rich yet bounded capsule.

## Checklist
- [x] Review existing documentation or practices related to context summarization (e.g., compact transcripts).
- [x] Draft design considerations (accuracy, completeness, size constraints).
- [x] Specify prompt template updates and data flow for capsule generation/consumption.
- [x] Record open questions and follow-up validation steps.

## Next Actions
- Socialize the design and gather feedback from maintainers.
- Prototype launcher/template integration following the Implementation Steps section.
