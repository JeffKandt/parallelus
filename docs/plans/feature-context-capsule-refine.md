# Branch Plan â€” feature/context-capsule-refine

## Objectives
- Refine the context capsule design to better capture exploratory discussions and user preferences that have not yet translated into plan/progress entries.
- Update the capsule prompt template with concrete guidance for summarising open-ended dialogue within token constraints.
- Document trade-offs between capsule detail and existing progress log hygiene so future agents can choose the right channel.
- Provide an easy workflow (e.g., Make helper) for capturing "remember this later" notes that feed capsule generation.

## Checklist
- [x] Review the current capsule design and prompt template for gaps around exploratory context.
- [x] Propose prompt language and structural updates to represent exploratory threads without exceeding token budgets.
- [ ] Capture recommendations about when to rely on capsules versus progress notebook updates.
- [x] Design a lightweight command for logging "remember this later" reminders.
- [x] Implement the helper and document how it flows into capsule generation.
- [x] Ship a prompt helper (`make capsule_prompt`) that instructs agents to dump full context into a capsule on demand.

## Next Actions
- Synthesize guidance clarifying when to prefer capsule reminders versus progress log updates.
- Update progress log after documenting findings and decisions.
- Socialise the `make remember_later` and `make capsule_prompt` workflows with maintainers.
- Capture implementation gaps (launcher flag, prompt wiring, monitor reporting, manual updates) and scope follow-on work to deliver the end-to-end capsule hand-off.
