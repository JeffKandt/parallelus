## Summary
- Verified AGENTS.md now routes every operational gate to the manuals under `docs/agents/manuals/`.
- Confirmed `docs/agents/manuals/git-workflow.md` documents merge, archive, and unmerged-branch triage expectations in line with guardrails.
- Cross-checked branch plan/progress notebooks to ensure the recorded work matches the relocation scope.

## Findings
- Severity: Medium | Area: Documentation | Summary: `docs/agents/README.md` still points to the pre-move file paths (`runtime-matrix.md`, `integrations/`) that no longer exist at the repo root.
  - Evidence: `docs/agents/README.md` references `runtime-matrix.md` and `integrations/`, but those files now live under `docs/agents/manuals/`.
  - Recommendation: Update `docs/agents/README.md` to link to `docs/agents/manuals/runtime-matrix.md` and `docs/agents/manuals/integrations/` so the index matches the new layout.
