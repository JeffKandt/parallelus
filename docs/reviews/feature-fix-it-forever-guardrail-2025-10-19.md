Reviewer: Codex Senior Architect (senior-review subagent)

## Summary
- Broken manual links in `docs/agents/README.md` block operators from reaching required manuals.

## Findings
- Severity: Blocker | Area: Documentation | Summary: Manual index links now point to non-existent paths
  - Evidence: `docs/agents/README.md:6` references `docs/agents/manuals/...` from within `docs/agents/README.md`, which resolves to `docs/agents/docs/agents/...` on GitHub and local Markdown renderers, returning 404.
  - Recommendation: Revert to relative paths (`manuals/runtime-matrix.md`, `manuals/integrations/`, `manuals/README.md`) so the links resolve correctly.

## Tests & Evidence Reviewed
- Static inspection of documentation changes; no automated tests run (doc-only review).

## Follow-Ups / Tickets
- [ ] Restore working manual links and rerun senior architect review once fixed.

## Provenance
- Model: GPT-5 Codex (default)
- Sandbox Mode: danger-full-access
- Approval Policy: never
- Session Mode: synchronous subagent
