## Findings
- **Severity: Low** – `create_runner` doubles the `local model_export`, `sandbox_export`, `approval_export`, `session_export`, and `writes_export` declarations `.agents/bin/launch_subagent.sh:62`. Bash tolerates duplicate `local` statements, but it is confusing for maintainers and risks future edits assigning to the wrong copy. Please drop the redundant block so each variable is declared once.
- **Severity: Low** – The senior-review scope template points operators at `origin/feature-publish-repo`, but the branch actually lives under `origin/feature/publish-repo` `docs/agents/templates/senior_architect_scope.md:5`. Anyone pasting the command as written will get a “unknown revision” error. Update the remote path to use the slash form.

## Summary
The monitor-loop manual now directs operators to supervise subagents via `make monitor_subagents ARGS="--id <entry>"`, capturing the cadence and cleanup guards we agreed on. `docs/progress/feature-publish-repo.md` logs the 2025-10-16 15:36:42 UTC acknowledgement, and the branch plan highlights the narrow delta for future reviewers. No new regressions surfaced; the previously noted low-severity cleanups remain outstanding.

## Recommendations
1. Clean up the duplicate `local` declarations in `create_runner` while the file is fresh.
2. Correct the remote reference in the senior-review scope template so reviewers can copy/paste it without fixes.
