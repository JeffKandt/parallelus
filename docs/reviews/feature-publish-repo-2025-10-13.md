## Findings
- **Severity: Low** – `create_runner` still doubles the `local model_export`, `sandbox_export`, `approval_export`, `session_export`, `constraints_export`, and `writes_export` declarations `.agents/bin/launch_subagent.sh:74-87`. Bash tolerates duplicate `local` statements, but it is confusing for maintainers and risks future edits assigning to the wrong copy. Please drop the redundant block so each variable is declared once.
- **Severity: Low** – The senior-review scope template still points operators at `origin/feature-publish-repo`, but the branch actually lives under `origin/feature/publish-repo` `docs/agents/templates/senior_architect_scope.md:5`. Anyone pasting the command as written will get an “unknown revision” error. Update the remote path to use the slash form.
- **Severity: Info** – The seeded `docs/agents/subagent-registry.json` entries reference the legacy `/Users/jeff/Code/interruptus/...` paths. Double-check that the history you publish should retain those host-specific locations (and scrub or annotate them if not), since new contributors will operate against the `parallelus` repo paths.

## Summary
The merge helper + managed hook now enforce the “no branch notebooks” guardrail with clear remediation text, and the git-workflow/plan/progress docs record the requirement along with the new monitor-loop expectations. I spot-checked the focused diff and didn’t find regressions; only the low-severity cleanups above remain.

## Recommendations
1. Clean up the duplicate `local` declarations in `create_runner` while the file is fresh.
2. Correct the remote reference in the senior-review scope template so reviewers can copy/paste it without fixes.
3. Decide whether the committed subagent registry should retain the legacy `interruptus` paths or be normalised for the published repo.
