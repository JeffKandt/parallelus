## Findings
- Severity: Info – Confirmed `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh` now nudges via `subagent_send_keys.sh`, emits tmux snapshots/log tails, and exits non-zero when alerts persist; manual-attention paths mark IDs stuck without regressing the multi-agent happy path.
- Severity: Info – Verified `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-real.sh` archives scenario evidence (session JSONL, Markdown transcript, deliverables) before cleanup and surfaces failures when harvest/copy steps miss—see `docs/guardrails/runs/20251027-194902-real-interactive-success/`.
- Severity: Info – Checked `.agents/tests/monitor_loop.py` assertions expect non-zero exits on runtime/heartbeat/stale alerts and keep operator warnings visible.
- Severity: Info – Reviewed documentation updates (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md`, `docs/agents/scopes/feature-claude-review-senior.md`) to ensure the workflow emphasises `make monitor_subagents`, log-tail inspection, and cautious nudging.

## Tests & Evidence Reviewed
- Diff inspection of `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh`, `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-real.sh`, `.agents/tests/monitor_loop.py`.
- Documentation updates in `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md`, `docs/agents/scopes/feature-claude-review-senior.md`.
- Run artefacts under `docs/guardrails/runs/20251027-194902-real-interactive-success/` (session log, transcript, deliverables, summary).
