## Summary
- Process guardrails now enforce retrospective-before-turn_end and verify reports before merge; CI passes.

## Findings
- Severity: Low | Area: Documentation | Summary: Reminder to create the planned validation bullet in branch plan and resolve before merge.
  - Evidence: docs/plans/feature-process-review-gate.md still lists 'Validate updated hooks and deployment flow'.
  - Recommendation: Complete or explicitly defer the validation task.

## Follow-Ups / Tickets
- [ ] Run make ci after validation work (owner to confirm before merge).
