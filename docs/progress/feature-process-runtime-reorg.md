# Branch Progress — feature/process-runtime-reorg

## 2026-02-04 20:05:30 UTC
**Objectives**
- implement process-vs-runtime reorg items from `docs/deployment-upgrade-and-layout-notes.md`
- update Beads integration docs based on current design discussion

**Work Performed**
- reviewed `AGENTS.md` guardrails and ran `make read_bootstrap`
- bootstrapped branch `feature/process-runtime-reorg` and started session `20251049-20260204200536-b8e8c8`
- captured initial objectives/checklist updates in the branch plan notebook

**Artifacts**
- `docs/plans/feature-process-runtime-reorg.md`
- `docs/progress/feature-process-runtime-reorg.md`

**Next Actions**
- review `docs/deployment-upgrade-and-layout-notes.md` and enumerate concrete reorg changes to implement
- update `docs/agents/integrations/beads.md` to reflect the branch/worktree semantics and “optional Beads” adoption strategy

## 2026-02-04 20:12:10 UTC
**Objectives**
- implement initial “process vs runtime” adjustments (reduce PR noise from runtime artifacts)
- update Beads docs based on current discussion (sync branch semantics; optional adoption)

**Work Performed**
- updated failures collection to scan runtime guardrail-run paths under `.parallelus/guardrails/runs/` (while retaining legacy `docs/guardrails/runs/` scanning)
- updated the rollout-extraction tool default output to `.parallelus/guardrails/runs/extracted` when no active session artifacts directory is available
- updated `docs/deployment-upgrade-and-layout-notes.md` and `docs/agents/project/structure.md` to clarify runtime-vs-tracked placement expectations
- updated `docs/agents/integrations/beads.md` to cover branches/worktrees vs “done” semantics, and to clarify the “optional Beads” pilot flow

**Artifacts**
- `.agents/bin/collect_failures.py`
- `.agents/bin/extract_codex_rollout.py`
- `docs/deployment-upgrade-and-layout-notes.md`
- `docs/agents/project/structure.md`
- `docs/agents/integrations/beads.md`

**Next Actions**
- run `make ci` and record results
- continue implementing any remaining reorg items from `docs/deployment-upgrade-and-layout-notes.md` that we agree are in-scope for this branch

## 2026-02-04 20:12:55 UTC
**Objectives**
- validate the branch via `make ci`

**Work Performed**
- ran `make ci` and confirmed the full suite passed

**Next Actions**
- decide whether any additional “process vs runtime” layout moves are needed beyond the current “write new run artifacts to `.parallelus/`” convention
