# Branch Progress — feature/publish-repo

## 2025-10-12 16:11:06 UTC
**Objectives**
- Prepare the repository for publication by wiring it to the new GitHub remote and pushing the current state.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` guardrails per session requirements.
- Ran `make bootstrap slug=publish-repo` to create `feature/publish-repo` branch scaffolding.
- Started session `20251012-121110-20251012161110-fdbc55` with prompt “Publishing repo to GitHub”.
- Added `origin` remote pointing to `git@github.com:JeffKandt/parallelus.git`.
- Pushed `main` and `feature/publish-repo` to the new GitHub repository.
- Replaced the top-level `README.md` with a comprehensive public overview of the Parallelus agent process, adoption paths, and workflow.
- Updated `.agents/bin/agents-alert` to allow interactive sessions without TTYs (e.g., tmux) to emit audio while keeping CI/subagents quiet unless overridden.
- Defaulted audible alerts to the macOS `Alex` voice via `AUDIBLE_ALERT_VOICE` so the speech synthesis path works consistently in headless shells.
- Marked subagent launch scripts with `SUBAGENT=1` (and default `CI=true`) so the alert helper can silence them automatically.
- Set `AUDIBLE_ALERT_REQUIRE_TTY=0` default in `.agents/agentrc` to align with the new behaviour.
- Expanded the README prerequisites and workflow notes to cover tmux requirements, status-bar config, Codex shell helpers, and the deploy script for reusable rollouts.
- Added Codex profile support to subagent launches (including the `--profile` flag, registry tracking, and prompt visibility) for hosted models like `gpt-oss`.
- Updated materials (README and `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md`) so humans see the new profile/tmux behaviour without digging into the code.
- Moved senior architect and auditor role configuration into YAML front matter within their prompts, removed the legacy `.agents/config/*.yaml`, and wired `subagent_manager` to parse/validate overrides (model, sandbox, approval, profile, allowed writes).
- Added the `--role` launch option plus prompt override summaries so operators know which runtime adjustments are in effect.
- Plumbed `config_overrides` through front matter so roles can inject Codex `-c key=value` settings (e.g., reasoning effort) without relying on named profiles and ensured dangerous sandbox flags are only skipped when a sandbox override is supplied.
- Renamed the retrospective role to `continuous_improvement_auditor`, introduced guardrail toggles/role selectors (`REQUIRE_AGENT_CI_AUDITS`, `AGENT_CI_AGENT_ROLE`, `REQUIRE_CODE_REVIEWS`, `CODE_REVIEW_AGENT_ROLE`), and wired `make turn_end` to require the configured audit report.

**Artifacts**
- .agents/prompts/agent_roles/senior_architect.md
- .agents/prompts/agent_roles/continuous_improvement_auditor.md

**Next Actions**
- None (informational cleanup only).

## 2025-10-12 19:50:02 UTC
**Summary**
- Exercised the new retrospective guardrail to confirm `make turn_end` fails without a report.

**Artifacts**
- docs/self-improvement/markers/feature-publish-repo.json
- docs/self-improvement/reports/feature-publish-repo--2025-10-12T16:11:06+00:00.json

**Next Actions**
- None pending; guardrail validated.

## 2025-10-12 23:36:44 UTC
**Objectives**
- Ensure `make read_bootstrap` applies the Parallelus tmux overlay when Codex runs inside a clean-environment tmux session.

**Work Planned**
- Update the read bootstrap helper to honor `PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET`.
- Confirm whether other tmux-touching scripts need adjustments.

**Work Performed**
- Taught `.agents/make/agents.mk` to pass `-S $PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET` to tmux commands and refresh the overlay on Codex start.
- Propagated the socket-aware tmux lookup to subagent tooling (`launch_subagent.sh`, `subagent_manager.sh`, `resume_in_tmux.sh`, `get_current_session_id.sh`) so they export `TMUX` when the clean Codex environment lacks it.
- Updated `agents-session-start` to emit the tmux exports via the provided socket for future session shells.
- Verified the behaviour by standing up a temporary tmux server, running `PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET=... make read_bootstrap`, and inspecting the status configuration applied to that server.

**Validation**
- `PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET=/tmp/parallelus-test.sock make read_bootstrap`
- `tmux -S /tmp/parallelus-test.sock show-option -g status-left`

**Next Actions**
- Monitor other tmux-integrated scripts for socket-awareness needs as they come up.

## 2025-10-12 23:49:32 UTC
**Objectives**
- Tweak the tmux overlay layout to show the branch next to the session name and move phase/window indicators to the right status segment.

**Work Performed**
- Updated `.agents/tmux/parallelus-status.tmux` so `status-left` renders the session name plus current branch, and `status-right` now includes phase, worktree, git state, window index, and heartbeat.
- Revalidated the overlay by loading it into a temporary tmux server with `PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET=/tmp/parallelus-test.sock make read_bootstrap` and inspecting the resulting status strings.

**Validation**
- `tmux -S /tmp/parallelus-test.sock show-option -g status-left`
- `tmux -S /tmp/parallelus-test.sock show-option -g status-right`

**Next Actions**
- Confirm the updated layout meets operator expectations during live Codex runs.

## 2025-10-12 23:56:42 UTC
**Objectives**
- Clarify the base worktree indicator and fine-tune status ordering per operator feedback.

**Work Performed**
- Changed `.agents/bin/subagent_prompt_phase.py` to emit `•` when running in the primary checkout so it no longer collides with branch names.
- Restructured the right-hand status string to lead with the active window id/title and keep phase, worktree marker, git state, and heartbeat separated by consistent dividers.
- Reloaded the tmux overlay on the active Codex socket to apply the new layout.

**Next Actions**
- Observe the new indicator in daily workflows and adjust the symbol if further clarity is needed.

## 2025-10-13 00:52:09 UTC
**Objectives**
- Kick off the Continuous Improvement audit for the current branch work.

**Work Performed**
- Launched `subagent_manager` with the CI auditor role; the generated scope reused the default bootstrap checklist, so the sandbox failed immediately on dirty-tree checks.
- Stopped the stray tmux pane (`tmux kill-pane -t %1`), forced cleanup of registry entry `20251013-004814-ci-audit`, and removed the temporary sandbox directory.

**Next Actions**
- Prepare a minimal CI-audit scope/prompt and re-run the auditor so the JSON report reflects today's changes before the next `make turn_end`.

## 2025-10-13 01:08:22 UTC
**Objectives**
- Deliver a successful Continuous Improvement audit run with a scope tailored to the current branch state.

**Work Performed**
- Added `docs/agents/templates/ci_audit_scope.md` as a reusable scope and enhanced `subagent_manager.sh` to normalize role prompts, pass the parent branch into CI-auditor instructions, and avoid bootstrap steps for that role.
- Updated the tmux prompt generator and related helpers to respect `PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET`, then launched `subagent_manager.sh launch --type throwaway --slug ci-audit --scope ... --role continuous_improvement_auditor.md` via tmux.
- Captured the auditor's JSON findings and wrote them to `docs/self-improvement/reports/feature-publish-repo--2025-10-12T16:11:06+00:00.json`, then cleaned the sandbox registry entry and deleted `.parallelus/` artifacts.
- Re-read `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` and recorded this acknowledgement here so future subagent launches meet the guardrail expectation.

**Validation**
- Verified the parsed JSON report contents before saving and confirmed `subagent_manager.sh status` reports no running entries.

**Next Actions**
- Address the auditor's follow-up items as we continue refining the CI audit tooling.

## 2025-10-13 02:01:29 UTC
**Objectives**
- Re-run the Continuous Improvement audit with the updated scope and capture the full transcript.

**Work Performed**
- Relaunched `subagent_manager.sh` with the CI auditor role and the new scope template; let the subagent complete without manual prompts.
- Captured the auditor pane to `docs/logs/ci-audit-20251013T015421.txt`, parsed the JSON output, and updated `docs/self-improvement/reports/feature-publish-repo--2025-10-12T16:11:06+00:00.json`.
- Cleaned the registry entry `20251013-015421-ci-audit` and deleted the throwaway sandbox directory.
- Documented the operator preference to store future subagent transcripts under `docs/logs/` and avoid manual prompts unless coordinated.
- Recreated the Python virtual environment, added `black`, `ruff`, and `pytest` to `requirements.txt`, and ran `make ci` to confirm lint and test targets now pass locally.
- Recorded the directive to archive the full main-agent console transcript for every session and fold transcript retrospectives into the turn-end checklist.

**Validation**
- `cat docs/logs/ci-audit-20251013T015421.txt`
- `cat docs/self-improvement/reports/feature-publish-repo--2025-10-12T16:11:06+00:00.json`
- `make ci`

## 2025-10-16 14:07:51 UTC
**Objectives**
- Harvest the completed senior architect review artifacts and log guardrail compliance for the follow-up work.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read the Parallelus Agent Core Guardrails instructions at session start and recorded the acknowledgement here before running additional project commands.
- Started session `20251018-20251016140710-af725c` with prompt “Harvest Sr Architect review results” to capture today's work context.
- Located the senior architect sandbox at `.parallelus/subagents/sandboxes/senior-review-RaAkSK` and inspected the generated review outputs.
- Copied `docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md` from the sandbox into the repository so the latest findings are available to the main branch team.

**Artifacts**
- docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md

**Next Actions**
- Triage and address the reported `role_read_only` blocker before requesting another review cycle.

## 2025-10-16 14:17:43 UTC
**Objectives**
- Clear the prior senior-review sandbox, fix the `role_read_only` regression, add coverage, and prep for a fresh review run.

**Work Performed**
- Closed the lingering senior-review tmux pane and force-cleaned registry entry `20251016-090313-senior-review`, then removed the stale sandbox directory.
- Re-read `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` ahead of launching new subagents and noted the acknowledgement here.
- Patched `.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh` to default `role_read_only="false"` before optional role loading so `set -u` environments survive no-role launches; updated logic now keeps the previous behaviour when a role prompt is supplied.
- Added `tests/test_basic.py::test_subagent_launch_without_role_succeeds` to exercise `subagent_manager.sh launch --type throwaway --slug <slug> --launcher manual` without a role and ensure the new default prevents crashes; the test force-cleans the sandbox afterwards to leave the registry in a cleaned state.
- Attempted `make ci`; the run tripped the existing monitor-loop timeout guardrail (`agents-monitor-loop` timed out after 5 s). Documenting here for follow-up while keeping the new smoke test passing under targeted pytest.

**Validation**
- `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_basic.py -k subagent_launch_without_role_succeeds -q`

**Next Actions**
- Commit and push the fixes, then relaunch the senior architect review to confirm the blocker is resolved.

## 2025-10-16 14:31:22 UTC
**Objectives**
- Relaunch the senior architect review against commit `956651c91218cf27b74350f5c0c540c2f899543f` and collect the updated findings.

**Work Performed**
- Pushed the latest fixes to `origin/feature-publish-repo`, launched `subagent_manager.sh` with the senior-architect scope/role, and monitored the session via `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh --id 20251016-141935-senior-review` until the heartbeat threshold tripped.
- Harvested deliverables and force-cleaned the sandbox once the reviewer confirmed completion, then closed the tmux pane and registry entry.
- Captured the new review report in `docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md`; the reviewer flagged a remaining High-severity issue in `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh` where runtime/log-age columns are misindexed.

**Artifacts**
- docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md

**Next Actions**
- Address the monitor-loop column parsing regression, add regression coverage, and request another senior architect pass.

## 2025-10-16 14:37:40 UTC
**Objectives**
- Restore the monitor-loop guardrails and tests before requesting the follow-up review.

**Work Performed**
- Updated `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh` to parse the status table via Python so runtime/log-age thresholds track the correct columns irrespective of spacing, emitting explicit metadata for exit conditions.
- Refreshed `.agents/tests/monitor_loop.py` stubs to match the current `subagent_manager.sh status` layout (including the Deliverables and Handle columns) and verified the runtime, heartbeat, and stale guards trigger as expected.
- Re-ran `make ci` to exercise the full lint/test suite and confirm the repaired monitor loop passes the self-test harness.

**Validation**
- `pytest .agents/tests/monitor_loop.py -q`
- `make ci`

**Next Actions**
- Launch the senior architect subagent again so the reviewer can verify the monitor-loop fix.
