# Branch Progress — feature/publish-repo

## 2025-10-12 16:11:06 UTC
**Objectives**
- Prepare the repository for publication by wiring it to the new GitHub remote and pushing the current state.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` guardrails per session requirements.
- Ran `make bootstrap slug=publish-repo` to create `feature/publish-repo` branch scaffolding.
- Started session `20251012-121110-20251012161110-fdbc55` with prompt “Publishing repo to GitHub”.
- Added `origin` remote pointing to `git@github.com:JeffKandt/parallelus.git`.
- Pushed `main` and `feature/publish-repo` to the new GitHub repository.
- Replaced the top-level `README.md` with a comprehensive public overview of the Parallelus agent process, adoption paths, and workflow.
- Updated `.agents/bin/agents-alert` to allow interactive sessions without TTYs (e.g., tmux) to emit audio while keeping CI/subagents quiet unless overridden.
- Defaulted audible alerts to the macOS `Alex` voice via `AUDIBLE_ALERT_VOICE` so the speech synthesis path works consistently in headless shells.
- Marked subagent launch scripts with `SUBAGENT=1` (and default `CI=true`) so the alert helper can silence them automatically.
- Set `AUDIBLE_ALERT_REQUIRE_TTY=0` default in `.agents/agentrc` to align with the new behaviour.
- Expanded the README prerequisites and workflow notes to cover tmux requirements, status-bar config, Codex shell helpers, and the deploy script for reusable rollouts.
