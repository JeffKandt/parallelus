# Branch Progress — feature/backlog-improvements

## 2025-10-16 21:34:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Restore the canonical progress log with the full set of historic branch updates.
- Capture follow-up guardrail work required to keep future folds lossless.

**Work Performed**
- Ran `make bootstrap slug=backlog-improvements` to open the feature branch and seed plan/progress notebooks.
- Parsed `feature-process-review-gate`, `feature-publish-repo`, and `feature-review-feature-publish-repo` notebooks (plus the pre-fold PROGRESS revision) into a single time-ordered dataset.
- Regenerated `docs/PROGRESS.md` from the parsed entries and spot-fixed formatting artefacts (duplicate “Next Actions”, missing top-level spacing).
- Updated the branch plan with the backlog/guardrail objectives and logged this session in the progress notebook.

**Artifacts**
- docs/PROGRESS.md
- docs/plans/feature-backlog-improvements.md
- docs/progress/feature-backlog-improvements.md

**Next Actions**
- Draft guardrail proposals (documentation + automation strategy) for maintainer review.

**Objectives**
- Implement the lossless folding guardrails and document the enforcement workflow.

**Work Performed**
- Added `.agents/bin/fold-progress` to render/verify canonical entries from branch notebooks and wired it into the managed pre-commit hook.
- Updated `docs/agents/git-workflow.md` to mandate verbatim folding via the helper (no summarisation) and refreshed the merge checklist accordingly.
- Implemented the Recon queue workflow (`make queue_init|queue_pull`) via `.agents/bin/branch-queue`, including dual sections for short-term vs backlog items, updated `.gitignore`, and documented usage.
- Verified the updated branch plan checklist captures completed work.

**Artifacts**
- .agents/bin/fold-progress
- .agents/bin/branch-queue
- .agents/hooks/pre-commit
- docs/agents/git-workflow.md
- docs/plans/feature-backlog-improvements.md
- docs/progress/feature-backlog-improvements.md

**Next Actions**
- Socialise the guardrail changes and run through an end-to-end fold on the next feature branch to confirm ergonomics.

**Objectives**
- Align agent-facing documentation with the human/agent partnership philosophy.

**Work Performed**
- Reinforced the core guardrails in `AGENTS.md` with guidance on outcome-focused communication.
- Updated `docs/agents/git-workflow.md` and `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` to clarify how the agent reports activities without asking the user to run commands.
- Added additional examples in `README.md` covering worktree-based subagent usage and refined user directives.
- Refilled `docs/agents/project/` with Parallelus-focused domain, structure, continuous-improvement, and customisation guidance.
- Authored `docs/agents/manuals/tmux-setup.md` and linked it from the guardrails so operators know how to provision the required tmux environment and use `.agents/bin/tmux-safe`.

**Artifacts**
- AGENTS.md
- README.md
- docs/agents/git-workflow.md
- docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md
- docs/agents/project/domain.md
- docs/agents/project/structure.md
- docs/agents/project/continuous_improvement.md
- docs/agents/project/README.md
- docs/agents/manuals/tmux-setup.md

**Next Actions**
- Review other manuals for similar communication adjustments as new workflows are introduced.
