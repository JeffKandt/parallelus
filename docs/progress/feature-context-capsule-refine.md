# Branch Progress â€” feature/context-capsule-refine

# 2025-10-26 14:20:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Clarify the implementation status of the capsule workflow and restore guardrail helpers broken by spacing regressions.

**Work Performed**
- Fixed tabbing in the `Makefile` so `make read_bootstrap` and other helpers run without "missing separator" errors.
- Ran `make read_bootstrap` to confirm guardrails now execute and noted lingering orphaned notebook warnings.
- Added an implementation status section to the capsule design doc outlining completed helpers versus the remaining runtime integration work.
- Updated the branch plan next actions to call out the outstanding launcher, prompt wiring, monitor, and documentation tasks required for a full rollout.

**Artifacts**
- Makefile
- docs/agents/prototypes/context-capsule.md
- docs/plans/feature-context-capsule-refine.md

**Next Actions**
- Prioritise the runtime integration tasks (launcher flag, prompt injection, monitor reporting, operational manual updates) so the capsule workflow becomes fully functional.

# 2025-10-25 18:30:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Deliver a one-command workflow that generates a full context capsule prompt for immediate hand-off.

**Work Performed**
- Implemented `scripts/capsule_prompt.py` and wired it to a new `make capsule_prompt` target that prints a ready-to-send instruction block with branch metadata, reminder inbox snapshot, and capsule expectations.
- Added optional stub generation, documentation updates, and Makefile help text so maintainers can request a full capsule dump without manual prompt crafting.
- Updated capsule design, template, and reminder docs to describe the new workflow and noted the helper in the branch plan.

**Artifacts**
- scripts/capsule_prompt.py
- Makefile
- docs/agents/prototypes/context-capsule.md
- docs/agents/templates/context_capsule_prompt.md
- docs/agents/capsules/remember-later.md
- docs/plans/feature-context-capsule-refine.md

**Next Actions**
- Capture the outstanding guidance differentiating capsule usage from progress notebook updates.

## 2025-10-25 16:40:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Build and document a low-friction helper for capturing "remember this later" prompts that feed context capsules.

**Work Performed**
- Implemented `scripts/remember_later.py` and wired it into a new `make remember_later` target with validation and tagging support.
- Added a capsule reminder inbox at `docs/agents/capsules/remember-later.md` and documented the workflow in the capsule design and prompt template.
- Smoke-tested the helper via `make remember_later` (writing to a temporary file) to confirm CLI behaviour.

**Artifacts**
- scripts/remember_later.py
- Makefile
- docs/agents/capsules/remember-later.md
- docs/agents/prototypes/context-capsule.md
- docs/agents/templates/context_capsule_prompt.md

**Next Actions**
- Capture guidance on when to escalate reminders into the progress notebook versus leaving them in the reminder inbox.

## 2025-10-24 19:55:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Reorient on guardrails and gather context for the "remember this later" helper request.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read root `AGENTS.md` guardrails and confirmed bootstrap status via `make read_bootstrap`.
- Reviewed the existing context capsule design and prompt template to identify integration points for a helper command.
- Updated the branch plan with objectives and checklist items covering the new helper workflow.

**Next Actions**
- Implement and document the helper that captures "remember this later" notes for future capsules.

## 2025-10-24 18:20:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Investigate how context capsules can preserve exploratory conversations that have not yet been formalised in plans or progress logs.
- Determine whether the capsule prompt or the existing notebook cadence should absorb this need.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed the current capsule hand-off design and template to identify missing guidance around speculative discussions and user preferences.
- Outlined the plan to revise documentation and prompt language so capsules can carry curated exploratory context without violating token constraints.
- Added concrete guidance to the design doc covering exploratory thread capture, capsule vs. progress notebook division of responsibility, and compression tips.
- Extended the capsule prompt template with an `Exploratory Threads & User Preferences` section for capturing open-ended dialogue and user reminders.

**Artifacts**
- docs/plans/feature-context-capsule-refine.md
- docs/agents/prototypes/context-capsule.md
- docs/agents/templates/context_capsule_prompt.md

**Next Actions**
- Share recommendations with the user on prompting strategies and when to lean on capsules versus notebook updates.
