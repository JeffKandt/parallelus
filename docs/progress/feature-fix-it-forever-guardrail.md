# Branch Progress — feature-fix-it-forever-guardrail

## 2025-10-19 18:40:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Enforce fix-it-forever and subagent guardrails.

**Work Performed**
- Hardened `.agents/bin/agents-turn-end` and `.agents/bin/agents-merge`; updated AGENTS.md with manual references.
- Moved the continuous-improvement playbook into `docs/agents/manuals/` and refreshed the manuals index.
- Documented senior-review baseline separately, archived manual reviews, and removed the temporary baseline callout.
- Updated `docs/agents/project/domain.md` to highlight the playbook for downstream repos.
- Added guidance in the continuous-improvement manual to upstream generalisable fixes after capturing them downstream.
- Authored `docs/agents/manuals/git-workflow.md` to document both direct merge and PR-based integration paths, and pointed AGENTS.md at the manual.
- Added scope-validation guards in `subagent_manager.sh` (placeholders must be replaced, branch must match, objectives filled), and updated the senior architect manual to call out placeholder replacement plus `make monitor_subagents`.

**Artifacts**
- .agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh
- .agents/bin/agents-turn-end
- .agents/bin/agents-merge

**Next Actions**

## 2025-10-19 20:31:27 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate outstanding checklist items before reattempting reviews.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read `AGENTS.md` to confirm guardrails for this session.
- Reviewed README “Next Steps” guidance; no changes required.
- Relocated subagent, runtime matrix, and integrations manuals into `docs/agents/manuals/` and updated references (AGENTS, templates, progress logs).
- Ran `make ci` to confirm requirements and `tests/test_basic.py` still pass; cleaned up incidental registry noise from the smoke sandbox entry.

**Next Actions**
- Stage when ready for senior architect review rerun.

## 2025-10-19 20:33:55 UTC
**Objectives**
- Investigate senior architect finding regarding git workflow manual coverage.

**Work Performed**
- Compared `docs/agents/manuals/git-workflow.md` with the legacy `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`.
- Restored archive and unmerged-branch triage guidance inside the manuals copy so the guardrail reference is accurate.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run focused review once requested.

## 2025-10-19 20:37:20 UTC
**Objectives**
- Prepare for senior architect review relaunch.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read `docs/agents/manuals/subagent-session-orchestration.md` as required before launching review subagents.
- Confirmed branch notebooks and docs are up to date for review.

**Next Actions**
- Launch senior architect review via subagent manager.
