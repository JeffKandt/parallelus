**Objectives**
- Enforce fix-it-forever and subagent guardrails.

**Work Performed**
- Hardened `.agents/bin/agents-turn-end` and `.agents/bin/agents-merge`; updated AGENTS.md with manual references.
- Moved the continuous-improvement playbook into `docs/agents/manuals/` and refreshed the manuals index.
- Documented senior-review baseline separately, archived manual reviews, and removed the temporary baseline callout.
- Updated `docs/agents/project/domain.md` to highlight the playbook for downstream repos.
- Added guidance in the continuous-improvement manual to upstream generalisable fixes after capturing them downstream.
