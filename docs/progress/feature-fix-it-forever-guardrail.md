# Branch Progress — feature-fix-it-forever-guardrail

## 2025-10-19 18:40:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Enforce fix-it-forever and subagent guardrails.

**Work Performed**
- Hardened `.agents/bin/agents-turn-end` and `.agents/bin/agents-merge`; updated AGENTS.md with manual references.
- Moved the continuous-improvement playbook into `docs/agents/manuals/` and refreshed the manuals index.
- Documented senior-review baseline separately, archived manual reviews, and removed the temporary baseline callout.
- Updated `docs/agents/project/domain.md` to highlight the playbook for downstream repos.
- Added guidance in the continuous-improvement manual to upstream generalisable fixes after capturing them downstream.
- Authored `docs/agents/manuals/git-workflow.md` to document both direct merge and PR-based integration paths, and pointed AGENTS.md at the manual.
- Added scope-validation guards in `subagent_manager.sh` (placeholders must be replaced, branch must match, objectives filled), and updated the senior architect manual to call out placeholder replacement plus `make monitor_subagents`.

**Artifacts**
- .agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh
- .agents/bin/agents-turn-end
- .agents/bin/agents-merge
- AGENTS.md
- docs/agents/manuals/continuous-improvement.md
- docs/agents/manuals/senior-architect.md
- docs/agents/manuals/git-workflow.md
- docs/agents/manuals/README.md
- docs/agents/project/domain.md
- archive/manual-reviews/

**Next Actions**
- Run subagent senior review when ready to merge into `main`.

## 2025-10-19 20:31:27 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate outstanding checklist items before reattempting reviews.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read `AGENTS.md` to confirm guardrails for this session.
- Reviewed README “Next Steps” guidance; no changes required.
- Relocated subagent, runtime matrix, and integrations manuals into `docs/agents/manuals/` and updated references (AGENTS, templates, progress logs).
- Ran `make ci` to confirm requirements and `tests/test_basic.py` still pass; cleaned up incidental registry noise from the smoke sandbox entry.

**Next Actions**
- Stage when ready for senior architect review rerun.

## 2025-10-19 20:33:55 UTC
**Objectives**
- Investigate senior architect finding regarding git workflow manual coverage.

**Work Performed**
- Compared `docs/agents/manuals/git-workflow.md` with the legacy `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`.
- Restored archive and unmerged-branch triage guidance inside the manuals copy so the guardrail reference is accurate.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run focused review once requested.

## 2025-10-19 20:37:20 UTC
**Objectives**
- Prepare for senior architect review relaunch.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read `docs/agents/manuals/subagent-session-orchestration.md` as required before launching review subagents.
- Confirmed branch notebooks and docs are up to date for review.

**Next Actions**
- Launch senior architect review via subagent manager.

## 2025-10-19 20:51:16 UTC
**Objectives**
- Capture senior architect review results.

**Work Performed**
- Launched synchronous subagent review (`subagent_manager.sh launch --type throwaway --slug senior-review ...`).
- Harvested review artifact and cleaned sandbox once complete.
- Review outcome: changes requested — update `docs/agents/README.md` links to new manuals before rerun.

**Next Actions**
- Correct README references and rerun senior architect review.

## 2025-10-19 21:08:58 UTC
**Objectives**
- Address reviewer concerns about repeated subagent orchestration errors.

**Work Performed**
- Confirmed the second senior-review subagent (`20251019-205333-senior-review`) was interrupted; captured logs, then ran `make monitor_subagents ARGS="--id ..."` followed by forced cleanup to avoid lingering registry entries.
- Noted failure points: manual reminder to launch the monitor loop via `make monitor_subagents`, ANSI escape noise when tailing sandbox logs, stray `.vscode/settings.json`, and tmux pane cleanup gaps.

**Next Actions**
- Document remediation plan with maintainer before resuming review.

## 2025-10-19 21:16:46 UTC
**Objectives**
- Implement remediation artifacts for review orchestration issues.

**Work Performed**
- Added a senior-review launch checklist, ANSI log scrubbing helper, and explicit tmux cleanup step to `docs/agents/manuals/subagent-session-orchestration.md`.
- Removed the stray `.vscode` directory and confirmed no additional copies remain under `.parallelus/`.
- Closed residual tmux panes from interrupted reviews; recorded state for future reference.

**Next Actions**
- Await maintainer go-ahead before attempting the senior architect review again.
