# Branch Progress — feature/review-feature-publish-repo

## 2025-10-13 03:53:50 UTC
**Objectives**
- Review guardrails, build an actionable plan, and diagnose the tmux overlay prompt injection.

**Work Performed**
- Read `AGENTS.md` as required at session start.
- Ran `make read_bootstrap` to confirm repo state (remote-connected, branch `feature/review-feature-publish-repo`).
- Attempted to start a new session with `SESSION_PROMPT="Investigate tmux overlay prompt injection" make start_session`; hit `/Users/jeff/Code/parallelus/.agents/bin/agents-session-start: line 163: tmux_args[@]: unbound variable`.
- Updated branch plan and progress notebooks with current objectives and troubleshooting steps.
- Patched `.agents/bin/agents-session-start` and `.agents/make/agents.mk` to guard tmux argument expansion and avoid prompting the terminal for device attributes.
- Re-ran `make read_bootstrap` and `SESSION_PROMPT="Investigate tmux overlay prompt injection" make start_session` successfully; new session `sessions/20251017-20251013040143-627b29` created without prompt leakage.

**Artifacts**
- docs/plans/feature-review-feature-publish-repo.md
- docs/progress/feature-review-feature-publish-repo.md

**Next Actions**
- Confirm the tmux overlay prompt leak no longer reproduces in an iTerm-driven session.
- Document the root cause and remediation steps for maintainers.
- Review whether additional tmux helpers need regression tests for control-mode fallbacks.

## 2025-10-13 05:10:44 UTC
**Objectives**
- Address the blocking review findings for the feature/publish-repo guardrails.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read `AGENTS.md` to confirm session guardrails and reopened the branch plan/progress notebooks.
- Updated the branch plan to prioritise the subagent env export fix and retrospective verifier slug handling.
- Captured the reviewer's outstanding findings to frame the remediation scope.

**Next Actions**
- Patch `role_config_to_env` to stop JSON-wrapping scalar role values and verify Codex respects the exports.
- Normalise branch names in `verify-retrospective` so missing markers for slash branches block `make turn_end`.
- Summarise the remediation and verification outcomes for maintainers.

## 2025-10-13 05:16:19 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate the role front-matter exports by running the CI agent audit subagent.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` in full per the subagent launch gate.
- Confirmed the branch plan still reflects the outstanding remediation tasks.

**Next Actions**
- Launch the CI agent audit via the updated subagent tooling and confirm it runs without quoted scalar exports.
- Capture audit outcomes and incorporate any follow-up tasks into the plan.

## 2025-10-13 05:19:01 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate that the CI auditor role launches with correctly quoted env overrides.

**Work Performed**
- Fired `.agents/bin/agents-alert` before kicking off the audit helper.
- Ran `.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh launch --type throwaway --slug ci-audit --scope docs/agents/templates/ci_audit_scope.md --role continuous_improvement_auditor.md`; inspected the generated `SUBAGENT_PROMPT.txt` and sandbox log to confirm `Codex profile: default (danger-full-access)` and the additional constraints string render without extra JSON quoting.
- Cleaned the throwaway sandbox via `subagent_manager.sh cleanup --id 20251013-051736-ci-audit --force` once verification was complete.

**Next Actions**
- Capture a brief remediation summary for maintainers (plan + docs update).
- Prepare to launch the senior architect review once the summary is ready.

## 2025-10-13 05:26:45 UTC
**Objectives**
- Let the CI auditor finish and archive its findings without interrupting the sandbox.

**Work Performed**
- Relaunched `.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh launch --type throwaway --slug ci-audit --scope docs/agents/templates/ci_audit_scope.md --role continuous_improvement_auditor.md` and left both tmux panes active until completion.
- Captured the transcript to `docs/logs/ci-audit-20251013T052311.txt` and parsed the JSON payload into `docs/self-improvement/reports/feature-review-feature-publish-repo--2025-10-13T05:23:00Z.json`.
- Cleaned the registry entry with `subagent_manager.sh cleanup --id 20251013-052311-ci-audit --force` once the output was saved.

**Next Actions**
- Fold the auditor follow-ups into the branch plan and remediation summary.
- Close the extra tmux pane left from the failed attempt to keep the workspace tidy.

## 2025-10-13 05:38:50 UTC
**Objectives**
- Plan the guardrail updates so subagent monitoring and cleanup become policy.

**Work Performed**
- Updated the branch plan to include the tmux-safe wrapper work, monitor-loop enforcement, and documentation tasks.

**Next Actions**
- Implement the wrapper/cleanup changes in the tooling.
- Capture the new workflow guidance in the manual and notebooks once the code changes land.

## 2025-10-13 05:42:48 UTC
**Objectives**
- Bake the tmux socket guard and monitor-loop requirements into the tooling.

**Work Performed**
- Added `.agents/bin/tmux-safe` and updated `subagent_manager.sh` to route every tmux call through it, including launch hints and cleanup teardown.
- Hardened `subagent_manager.sh cleanup` to refuse live sessions unless `--force` is passed and surfaced `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh --id <entry>` as the canonical way to decide when cleanup is safe.
- Logged the new guidance in `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md`.

**Next Actions**
- Incorporate the CI auditor follow-ups into the remediation summary and plan.
- Trigger the senior architect review once the summary is ready.

## 2025-10-13 05:45:27 UTC
**Objectives**
- Summarise the remediation work for maintainers and capture CI auditor follow-ups.

**Work Performed**
- Drafted a maintainer-facing summary covering the scalar export fix, retrospective verifier slug guard, CI auditor validation, and the new monitor-loop/cleanup guardrails now logged in the manual.
- Listed the CI auditor follow-ups that still need resolution (missing marker for `feature/publish-repo`, ensuring audits run on the feature branch instead of `main`, and rehydrating that branch’s plan/progress notebooks).

**Next Actions**
- Decide whether to restore the `feature/publish-repo` marker/notebooks within this branch or delegate to the owning feature branch.
- Prep the senior architect review package once the above decision is recorded.

## 2025-10-13 05:57:55 UTC
**Objectives**
- Complete the senior architect review to validate the role front-matter flow.

**Work Performed**
- Launched `subagent_manager.sh` with `--slug senior-review --role senior_architect.md` and monitored it via `agents-monitor-loop.sh --id 20251013-054559-senior-review`.
- After the monitor loop flagged a stale heartbeat, inspected the tmux pane, captured the final findings, sent `Ctrl+C` to terminate the idle Codex prompt, and only then forced cleanup.
- Archived the subagent log to `docs/logs/senior-review-20251013T054559.txt` and synced the reviewer’s findings into `docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md`.

**Review Outcome**
- `requirements.txt` needs the Python toolchain (`ruff`, `black`, `pytest`) so the adapter-driven `make ci` succeeds.
- `tracked_env_vars` in `subagent_manager.sh` must also restore `SUBAGENT_CODEX_CONFIG_OVERRIDES` to prevent role bleed-through.
- The tmux heartbeat overlay should surface the maximum log age, not the minimum, to expose stalled subagents.

**Next Actions**
- Prioritise fixes for the three review findings (either within this branch or delegated with a recorded plan).
- Re-run targeted checks (CI + monitor overlay) once fixes land, then loop back for review sign-off.
- Update the guardrails to mandate durable, versioned mitigations (no branch-only fixes) so the monitor-loop expectation is baked into the repo.

## 2025-10-13 06:24:31 UTC
**Objectives**
- Knock down the senior architect review blockers.

**Work Performed**
- Added `SUBAGENT_CODEX_CONFIG_OVERRIDES` to the tracked/restore set in `.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh` so role overrides no longer bleed into subsequent launches.
- Updated `.agents/bin/subagent_prompt_phase.py` to report the maximum log age across running subagents, restoring the intended stale-heartbeat signal.

**Next Actions**
- Rerun the relevant validation (e.g., `make monitor_subagents` during the next subagent launch) to demonstrate the heartbeat fix.
- Confirm the Python toolchain dependency change remains intact and ready for CI rerun.

## 2025-10-13 07:03:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Stabilise throwaway sandbox creation and capture remaining TODOs.

**Work Performed**
- Switched throwaway sandbox creation to `git clone` the current commit instead of invoking `.agents/bin/deploy_agents_process.sh`, avoiding implicit `make bootstrap` calls that clobbered the main repo.
- Logged the repo-level TODOs (refresh `docs/agents/project/`, lock down subagent allowed writes) in `docs/PLAN.md`.

**Next Actions**
- Rerun the senior architect review with `make monitor_subagents` now that sandbox creation is isolated.
- Follow through on the plan-level TODOs after review sign-off.
