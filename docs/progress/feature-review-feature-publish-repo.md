# Branch Progress — feature/review-feature-publish-repo

## 2025-10-16 04:56:39 UTC
**Objectives**
- Automate collection of senior-review artifacts and surface deliverable status in the tooling.

**Work Performed**
- Extended `subagent_manager.sh launch` with `--deliverable` support; registry entries now capture expected artifacts and expose a `Deliverables` status column.
- Added `subagent_manager.sh harvest` to copy sandbox outputs into the repo and update registry metadata.
- Taught `agents-monitor-loop.sh` to flag entries with pending deliverables and display the harvest command on exit.
- Updated the subagent orchestration manual to document the new flow and inserted follow-up actions into the branch plan.

**Next Actions**
- Test the deliverable harvest workflow on the next senior-review run and capture the resulting review/log files via the new helper.
- Continue working through remaining review follow-ups (CI auditor fixes, documentation refresh) before reattempting the senior architect review.

## 2025-10-16 05:49:20 UTC
**Objectives**
- Prep for another senior architect review run after updating the orchestration flow.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read the updated `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` to confirm the log-tail workflow and captured this acknowledgement prior to launching/monitoring new subagents.

**Next Actions**
- Launch the senior-review subagent with explicit deliverables and monitor it through completion.

## 2025-10-16 06:21:11 UTC
**Objectives**
- Diagnose the stalled monitor loop after launching the senior-review subagent.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed the subagent log snippet showing the expected write-permission warning (review-only sandbox).
- Captured the registry state (`status=running`, deliverables pending) after the subagent completed, confirming the monitor loop never triggered the heartbeat threshold.
- Identified the regression in `agents-monitor-loop.sh`: the new Deliverables column shifted field positions, so the AWK parser no longer read runtime/log columns, preventing the 10-minute timeout from firing.
- Patched the monitor script to reference the updated column layout and avoid false negatives.
- Logged follow-up TODOs in the branch plan, including adding a completion signal for the monitor.
- Verified the fix by rerunning the loop (`make monitor_subagents ARGS="--id …"`), which now flags the heartbeat breach immediately.
- Harvested only the review artifact (after briefly copying the transcript to satisfy the stale `docs/logs` deliverable) and removed the accidental `docs/docs/` duplication; noted the plan update to drop the log deliverable going forward.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run the monitor loop with the fixed script to verify it now exits when log age exceeds the threshold (keeping the existing subagent pane open for analysis).
- Implement and test a sentinel-based completion signal so future loops can detect finished runs without relying solely on log age.

## 2025-10-16 06:40:24 UTC
**Objectives**
- Address the senior-review findings (PyYAML dependency, override quoting/restoration) and tidy the harvested artifacts.

**Work Performed**
- Closed the idle senior-review tmux pane, removed the mistaken `docs/docs` duplication, and pruned the temporary log copy so only the review artifact remains.
- Logged plan updates to drop the extra `docs/logs` deliverable and queued TODOs for the completion sentinel.

**Next Actions**
- Add `PyYAML` to the managed dependencies and verify role parsing works on a clean environment.
- Fix scalar quoting/override restoration in `subagent_manager.sh`, then run smoke launches to confirm no bleed-through.

## 2025-10-16 06:47:33 UTC
**Objectives**
- Relaunch the senior architect review with the monitoring fix and reduced deliverables.

**Work Performed**
- Confirmed `PyYAML` imports succeed after the dependency pin so role prompts load.
- Prepared to relaunch the review with only the `docs/reviews/` deliverable.

**Next Actions**
- Fire the senior-review subagent and monitor via `make monitor_subagents` to validate the heartbeat exit/harvest flow end-to-end.

## 2025-10-16 07:06:37 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate the senior-review workflow end-to-end with the monitor fix in place.

**Work Performed**
- Launched the senior-review subagent (`20251016-064757-senior-review`) with only the `docs/reviews/` deliverable, monitored it, and confirmed the loop exits once the heartbeat exceeds the 3-minute threshold.
- Harvested the review artifact, updated the registry entry, and cleaned the sandbox after ensuring no live pane remained.

**Next Actions**
- Fold the new review notes into the remediation plan and proceed with addressing the remaining TODOs before the next rerun.

## 2025-10-16 07:15:22 UTC
**Objectives**
- Prevent future senior-review launches on dirty worktrees and refresh the manual.

**Work Performed**
- Added a clean-worktree guard in `subagent_manager.sh` that blocks senior architect launches when local edits exist, ensuring reviews always run against committed state.
- Documented the requirement in the orchestration manual so operators know to commit or stash before requesting review.

**Next Actions**
- Stage and commit the PyYAML/override fixes so the next senior-review run sees the updated environment.

## 2025-10-16 08:06:51 UTC
**Objectives**
- Address the new CI auditor findings from the post-merge senior review.

**Work Performed**
- Parameterised `docs/agents/templates/ci_audit_scope.md` (branch/marker placeholders) so the template no longer hard-codes `feature/publish-repo`.
- Corrected `subagent_manager.sh` to reference the auditor manual under `.agents/prompts/…`.

**Next Actions**
- Commit the CI auditor template/manual fixes and rerun the senior architect review on `feature/publish-repo` to validate the clean report.

## 2025-10-16 08:30:15 UTC
**Objectives**
- Finalise CI auditor workflow fixes and capture the hand-off guidance.

**Work Performed**
- Updated the launch helper to render scope placeholders automatically and documented the behaviour (including the “no deliverables” harvest note) in the orchestration manual.
- Harvested and cleaned the latest senior-review sandbox before amending the registry.

**Next Actions**
- Rerun the senior architect review on `feature/publish-repo` to confirm the auditor fixes clear the outstanding findings.

**Next Actions**
- Stage and commit the PyYAML/override fixes so the next senior-review run sees the updated environment.
## 2025-10-15 21:41:28 UTC
**Objectives**
- Reconfirm guardrails and capture the current branch/subagent context.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed the Parallelus Agent Core Guardrails and noted the acknowledgement here before continuing.
- Ran `make read_bootstrap` to snapshot repo state ahead of investigating the branch divergence.

**Next Actions**
- Clean up the leftover `senior-review-kE0C7y` subagent sandbox and remove the `.parallelus` artefacts before committing.
- Ensure the branch plan reflects the latest remediation/status updates once cleanup is complete.

## 2025-10-13 03:53:50 UTC
**Objectives**
- Review guardrails, build an actionable plan, and diagnose the tmux overlay prompt injection.

**Work Performed**
- Read `AGENTS.md` as required at session start.
- Ran `make read_bootstrap` to confirm repo state (remote-connected, branch `feature/review-feature-publish-repo`).
- Attempted to start a new session with `SESSION_PROMPT="Investigate tmux overlay prompt injection" make start_session`; hit `/Users/jeff/Code/parallelus/.agents/bin/agents-session-start: line 163: tmux_args[@]: unbound variable`.
- Updated branch plan and progress notebooks with current objectives and troubleshooting steps.
- Patched `.agents/bin/agents-session-start` and `.agents/make/agents.mk` to guard tmux argument expansion and avoid prompting the terminal for device attributes.
- Re-ran `make read_bootstrap` and `SESSION_PROMPT="Investigate tmux overlay prompt injection" make start_session` successfully; new session `sessions/20251017-20251013040143-627b29` created without prompt leakage.

**Artifacts**
- docs/plans/feature-review-feature-publish-repo.md
- docs/progress/feature-review-feature-publish-repo.md

**Next Actions**
- Confirm the tmux overlay prompt leak no longer reproduces in an iTerm-driven session.
- Document the root cause and remediation steps for maintainers.
- Review whether additional tmux helpers need regression tests for control-mode fallbacks.

## 2025-10-13 05:10:44 UTC
**Objectives**
- Address the blocking review findings for the feature/publish-repo guardrails.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read `AGENTS.md` to confirm session guardrails and reopened the branch plan/progress notebooks.
- Updated the branch plan to prioritise the subagent env export fix and retrospective verifier slug handling.
- Captured the reviewer's outstanding findings to frame the remediation scope.

**Next Actions**
- Patch `role_config_to_env` to stop JSON-wrapping scalar role values and verify Codex respects the exports.
- Normalise branch names in `verify-retrospective` so missing markers for slash branches block `make turn_end`.
- Summarise the remediation and verification outcomes for maintainers.

## 2025-10-13 05:16:19 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate the role front-matter exports by running the CI agent audit subagent.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` in full per the subagent launch gate.
- Confirmed the branch plan still reflects the outstanding remediation tasks.

**Next Actions**
- Launch the CI agent audit via the updated subagent tooling and confirm it runs without quoted scalar exports.
- Capture audit outcomes and incorporate any follow-up tasks into the plan.

## 2025-10-13 05:19:01 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate that the CI auditor role launches with correctly quoted env overrides.

**Work Performed**
- Fired `.agents/bin/agents-alert` before kicking off the audit helper.
- Ran `.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh launch --type throwaway --slug ci-audit --scope docs/agents/templates/ci_audit_scope.md --role continuous_improvement_auditor.md`; inspected the generated `SUBAGENT_PROMPT.txt` and sandbox log to confirm `Codex profile: default (danger-full-access)` and the additional constraints string render without extra JSON quoting.
- Cleaned the throwaway sandbox via `subagent_manager.sh cleanup --id 20251013-051736-ci-audit --force` once verification was complete.

**Next Actions**
- Capture a brief remediation summary for maintainers (plan + docs update).
- Prepare to launch the senior architect review once the summary is ready.

## 2025-10-13 05:26:45 UTC
**Objectives**
- Let the CI auditor finish and archive its findings without interrupting the sandbox.

**Work Performed**
- Relaunched `.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh launch --type throwaway --slug ci-audit --scope docs/agents/templates/ci_audit_scope.md --role continuous_improvement_auditor.md` and left both tmux panes active until completion.
- Captured the transcript to `docs/logs/ci-audit-20251013T052311.txt` and parsed the JSON payload into `docs/self-improvement/reports/feature-review-feature-publish-repo--2025-10-13T05:23:00Z.json`.
- Cleaned the registry entry with `subagent_manager.sh cleanup --id 20251013-052311-ci-audit --force` once the output was saved.

**Next Actions**
- Fold the auditor follow-ups into the branch plan and remediation summary.
- Close the extra tmux pane left from the failed attempt to keep the workspace tidy.

## 2025-10-13 05:38:50 UTC
**Objectives**
- Plan the guardrail updates so subagent monitoring and cleanup become policy.

**Work Performed**
- Updated the branch plan to include the tmux-safe wrapper work, monitor-loop enforcement, and documentation tasks.

**Next Actions**
- Implement the wrapper/cleanup changes in the tooling.
- Capture the new workflow guidance in the manual and notebooks once the code changes land.

## 2025-10-13 05:42:48 UTC
**Objectives**
- Bake the tmux socket guard and monitor-loop requirements into the tooling.

**Work Performed**
- Added `.agents/bin/tmux-safe` and updated `subagent_manager.sh` to route every tmux call through it, including launch hints and cleanup teardown.
- Hardened `subagent_manager.sh cleanup` to refuse live sessions unless `--force` is passed and surfaced `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh --id <entry>` as the canonical way to decide when cleanup is safe.
- Logged the new guidance in `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md`.

**Next Actions**
- Incorporate the CI auditor follow-ups into the remediation summary and plan.
- Trigger the senior architect review once the summary is ready.

## 2025-10-13 05:45:27 UTC
**Objectives**
- Summarise the remediation work for maintainers and capture CI auditor follow-ups.

**Work Performed**
- Drafted a maintainer-facing summary covering the scalar export fix, retrospective verifier slug guard, CI auditor validation, and the new monitor-loop/cleanup guardrails now logged in the manual.
- Listed the CI auditor follow-ups that still need resolution (missing marker for `feature/publish-repo`, ensuring audits run on the feature branch instead of `main`, and rehydrating that branch’s plan/progress notebooks).

**Next Actions**
- Decide whether to restore the `feature/publish-repo` marker/notebooks within this branch or delegate to the owning feature branch.
- Prep the senior architect review package once the above decision is recorded.

## 2025-10-13 05:57:55 UTC
**Objectives**
- Complete the senior architect review to validate the role front-matter flow.

**Work Performed**
- Launched `subagent_manager.sh` with `--slug senior-review --role senior_architect.md` and monitored it via `agents-monitor-loop.sh --id 20251013-054559-senior-review`.
- After the monitor loop flagged a stale heartbeat, inspected the tmux pane, captured the final findings, sent `Ctrl+C` to terminate the idle Codex prompt, and only then forced cleanup.
- Archived the subagent log to `docs/logs/senior-review-20251013T054559.txt` and synced the reviewer’s findings into `docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md`.

**Review Outcome**
- `requirements.txt` needs the Python toolchain (`ruff`, `black`, `pytest`) so the adapter-driven `make ci` succeeds.
- `tracked_env_vars` in `subagent_manager.sh` must also restore `SUBAGENT_CODEX_CONFIG_OVERRIDES` to prevent role bleed-through.
- The tmux heartbeat overlay should surface the maximum log age, not the minimum, to expose stalled subagents.

**Next Actions**
- Prioritise fixes for the three review findings (either within this branch or delegated with a recorded plan).
- Re-run targeted checks (CI + monitor overlay) once fixes land, then loop back for review sign-off.
- Update the guardrails to mandate durable, versioned mitigations (no branch-only fixes) so the monitor-loop expectation is baked into the repo.

## 2025-10-13 06:24:31 UTC
**Objectives**
- Knock down the senior architect review blockers.

**Work Performed**
- Added `SUBAGENT_CODEX_CONFIG_OVERRIDES` to the tracked/restore set in `.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh` so role overrides no longer bleed into subsequent launches.
- Updated `.agents/bin/subagent_prompt_phase.py` to report the maximum log age across running subagents, restoring the intended stale-heartbeat signal.

**Next Actions**
- Rerun the relevant validation (e.g., `make monitor_subagents` during the next subagent launch) to demonstrate the heartbeat fix.
- Confirm the Python toolchain dependency change remains intact and ready for CI rerun.

## 2025-10-13 07:03:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Stabilise throwaway sandbox creation and capture remaining TODOs.

**Work Performed**
- Switched throwaway sandbox creation to `git clone` the current commit instead of invoking `.agents/bin/deploy_agents_process.sh`, avoiding implicit `make bootstrap` calls that clobbered the main repo.
- Logged the repo-level TODOs (refresh `docs/agents/project/`, lock down subagent allowed writes) in `docs/PLAN.md`.

**Next Actions**
- Rerun the senior architect review with `make monitor_subagents` now that sandbox creation is isolated.
- Follow through on the plan-level TODOs after review sign-off.

## 2025-10-13 07:43:30 UTC
**Objectives**
- Re-run the senior architect review on the committed branch.

**Work Performed**
- Launched `subagent_manager.sh launch --type throwaway --slug senior-review --scope docs/agents/templates/senior_architect_scope.md --role senior_architect.md` against commit `feba011`; monitored it via `make monitor_subagents ARGS="--id 20251013-072554-senior-review …"` until the log heartbeat stalled at the 3-minute mark.
- Captured the subagent’s analysis up to the stall (log confirms review drafting started) and force-cleaned the sandbox to avoid leaving a running entry.
- Restarted the review (`id=20251013-074311-senior-review`) but paused work here so the next session can continue with a fresh monitor loop.

**Next Actions**
- Resume the latest senior-review run (`make monitor_subagents ARGS="--id 20251013-074311-senior-review"`) and let it finish; capture the generated review file in the main repo.
- If the subagent still stalls, investigate the missing `python3` tooling inside the sandbox before relaunching.
