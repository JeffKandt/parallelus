# Branch Progress â€” feature/process-review-gate

## ${DATE_STR}
**Objectives**
- Implement synchronous retrospective workflow with role configs and merge gating.

**Work Performed**
- Persisted senior architect defaults, added agent coach/auditor prompts, replaced auto retrospectives with marker + synchronous audit flow, tightened merge/deploy guardrails.
- Simplified retrospective prompts by consolidating coach/auditor roles into a single read-only auditor instruction set.
- Enforced audit-before-turn_end by validating the previous marker/report pair and documented the workflow updates; adjusted smoke tests accordingly.
- Captured senior architect approval (feature-process-review-gate-20251012.md) and retrospective report linked to marker.

**Artifacts**
- `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/bin/agents-turn-end`, `.agents/bin/retro-marker`, `.agents/bin/agents-merge`, `.agents/hooks/pre-merge-commit`, `.agents/config/*.yaml`, `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/*.md`, `docs/agents/*`, `docs/self-improvement/**/*`, `tests/test_basic.py`.

**Next Actions**
- Run `make ci` after addressing Swift lint dependency or document the requirement; capture a sample retrospective report using the new workflow.
