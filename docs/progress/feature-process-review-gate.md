**Objectives**
- Finalise retrospective workflow and validation ahead of merge.

**Work Performed**
- Re-ran `make ci` (pass) to validate hook/deployment changes after disabling the Swift adapter.
- Persisted senior architect defaults, added read-only retrospective auditor prompt, and enforced audit-before-turn_end with marker validation and updated smoke tests.
- Captured senior architect approval (`docs/reviews/feature-process-review-gate-20251012.md`) and retrospective report aligned to the latest marker.

**Artifacts**
- `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/bin/retro-marker`, `.agents/bin/agents-merge`, `.agents/hooks/pre-merge-commit`, `.agents/config/*.yaml`, `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/agent_auditor.md`, `docs/self-improvement/markers/feature-process-review-gate.json`, `docs/self-improvement/reports/feature-process-review-gate--2025-10-12T10:20:26.400945+00:00.json`.
