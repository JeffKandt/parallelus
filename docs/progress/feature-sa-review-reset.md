**Objectives**
- Establish the last subagent-driven senior review baseline and quarantine manual reviews.

**Work Performed**
- Bootstrapped branch, outlined plan, and moved manual reviews from 2025-10-19 into `archive/manual-reviews/`.
- Noted baseline commit `c2eab8b0c9d86b01a14b4c0e7073cddffb010e70` in the senior architect manual and tagged it as `review-baseline-2025-10-12` for easy reference.
- Highlighted the “fix it once, fix it forever” philosophy in `docs/agents/project/domain.md` so it appears in the core project narrative.

**Artifacts**
- archive/manual-reviews/
- docs/agents/manuals/senior-architect.md
- docs/agents/project/domain.md
- git tag `review-baseline-2025-10-12`

**Next Actions**
- Remove branch plan/progress after merge.
