# Branch Progress â€” feature-claude-review

## 2025-10-27 20:58:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Restore branch notebooks and outline the guardrail follow-up work.

**Work Performed**
- Recreated the branch plan/progress notebooks to resume logging.
- Captured the new objective: allow doc-only commits between review and merge.

**Objectives**
- Allow benign documentation changes after the senior architect review without rerunning the review.

**Work Performed**
- Updated `agents-merge` to permit any number of post-review commits provided all touched files live in guardrail-safe paths.
- Added regression tests (`.agents/tests/test_agents_merge_benign.py`) covering both allowed and disallowed scenarios.
- Documented the new behaviour in `docs/agents/git-workflow.md` and reran `make ci` to validate the change.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run the senior architect review on commit 626e72c69eeb53c6bcfb65b53ccf9597d5011c88 before merging.
- Monitor upcoming merges to ensure the benign-diff guardrail works as intended.
