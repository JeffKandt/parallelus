# Branch Progress — feature/claude-review

## 2025-10-20 14:22:31 UTC
**Objectives**
- Capture the two uncommitted CLAUDE documentation files on a dedicated feature branch and bring supporting guardrail artifacts up to date.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` guardrails on 2025-10-20 and seeded session `20251020-20251020142213-4fe453`.
- Bootstrapped branch `feature/claude-review`, restored the CLAUDE documentation files, and committed them alongside plan/progress updates.
- Logged top three improvement suggestions from `docs/claude-review.md` into the branch plan for future execution.
- Captured action item to draft a design document consolidating testing strategy and guardrail improvements.
- Authored `docs/claude-review-design.md` covering automated testing design, downstream guidance, and guardrail hardening tasks.
- Expanded downstream guidance to clarify how repo-specific unit/integration suites can hook into guardrail entry points.
- Clarified the design doc to describe the single existing path-based exemption (merge-only) and the motivation for a shared config.
- Refined the timeout/recovery section to reflect the current monitor-loop behaviour (threshold breaches exit) and outline automated follow-up actions.
- Added deliverable manifest gating (applied to every subagent type, including CI audits) so completion depends on verified outputs rather than ad-hoc signals.
- Noted that once automated recovery is trustworthy, we’ll shrink monitor thresholds to catch completions faster, accepting occasional re-check cycles.
- Highlighted that the monitor must manage multiple simultaneous subagents and remain active until all registered runs finish.
- Implemented the first tranche of monitor hardening: per-ID investigations, tmux nudges, manifest-aware JSON telemetry, and continued polling until every subagent completes.
- Smoke-checked the loop via `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh --iterations 1`; `pytest` unavailable locally (command missing) so broader tests deferred.
- Tightened default monitor thresholds (interval 30s, log 90s, runtime 240s) to force early-break scenarios during ongoing validation.
- Codified a reusable monitor scenario harness at `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` that spins up representative subagent behaviours for manual testing today and future automated coverage.
- Extended the monitor to capture tmux pane snapshots on alerts, giving us transcripts for analysing prompts and improving automated guidance.
- Updated the manual monitor harness to keep its tmux session visible by default (when already inside tmux), making live observation of subagent panes straightforward.
- Adjusted the harness layout to match production UX (main pane on the left, subagents stacked in the right half) so manual runs look exactly like real multi-subagent sessions.

## 2025-10-21 05:01:46 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate the synthetic subagent monitor harness end-to-end and confirm the monitor loop closes without manual intervention.

**Work Performed**
- Ran `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` in synthetic mode; observed the `await-prompt` worker stay blocked after the nudge, leaving the monitor loop waiting indefinitely.
- Confirmed no deliverables were harvested because subagent stubs never exited; no verification/cleanup path exercised.
- Manually killed lingering tmux panes and removed temporary sandboxes/registry entries to restore a clean baseline for the next session.

**Artifacts**
- .parallelus/test-monitor-scenario/ (removed after run)
- docs/agents/subagent-registry.json (synthetic entries pruned)

**Next Actions**
- Modify the synthetic harness so nudged workers log the response and exit, allowing the monitor to finish without manual cleanup.
- Re-run the synthetic scenario to ensure panes auto-close and logs reflect the completed runs before implementing the real Codex harness.

**Artifacts**
- CLAUDE.md
- docs/claude-review.md
- docs/plans/feature-claude-review.md
- docs/progress/feature-claude-review.md

**Next Actions**
- Monitor for requested revisions or follow-up tasks related to CLAUDE documentation.
- Scope automated guardrail tooling tests and define approach.
- Consolidate documentation-only path patterns via shared configuration.
- Plan timeout and recovery enhancements for subagent management workflow.
- Draft guardrail design document covering testing strategy and repo adoption guidance.
- Socialize design document with reviewers and iterate on feedback.
- Monitor the hardened subagent loop in real scenarios and collect follow-up tuning notes (threshold adjustment, additional nudges).
- Re-evaluate thresholds after collecting telemetry to ensure they balance responsiveness with noise.
- Review captured pane snapshots to design smarter, context-aware nudging and potential main-agent handoffs.

## 2025-10-21 05:06:40 UTC
**Objectives**
- Unblock the synthetic monitor scenario so nudged workers log activity and exit cleanly, allowing the monitor loop to finish without manual cleanup.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` on 2025-10-21 before continuing work and initiated session `20251022-20251021050635-41c436`.
- Confirmed outstanding next steps from the previous run and inspected `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` to understand current nudge handling.

**Next Actions**
- Implement logging/exit handling for the synthetic `await-prompt` worker when nudged.
- Re-run the synthetic harness to verify panes close automatically and monitor output reports a successful nudge response.

## 2025-10-21 05:15:20 UTC
**Objectives**
- Ensure the synthetic monitor scenario exits cleanly after a nudge by updating worker behaviour and validating the loop.

**Work Performed**
- Updated `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` so the `await-prompt` worker times out safely, logs the received nudge (with timestamp), and exits with success once input arrives; failures now surface if no nudge is delivered.
- Hardened tmux pane management by replacing the negative index lookup with an explicit last-index calculation to avoid bash array errors in detached sessions.
- Attempted to run the synthetic harness headlessly via `tmux new-session` and directly within the current tmux session; both runs showed the worker timing out without detecting the injected nudge, indicating further investigation needed into monitor-to-pane signalling in this environment.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` within an interactive tmux workspace to confirm the nudge path triggers log updates and clean exits (the automated headless runs still timed out).
- If the nudge continues to miss, instrument `agents-monitor-loop.sh` to capture the pane targets and confirm `send-keys` succeeds during the synthetic scenario.

## 2025-10-21 05:37:12 UTC
**Objectives**
- Diagnose why tmux panes linger between synthetic monitor runs and ensure cleanup doesn’t disrupt the user’s workspace.

**Work Performed**
- Began another harness run with additional logging; user observed multiple `await-prompt-fail` panes stacking because KEEP_SESSION left panes open and runs overlapped. Stopped the harness and manually closed panes `%112`, `%118`, `%124` to restore a single active pane.
- Captured monitor output (`/private/var/folders/.../tmp.QEbfMr6OaF`) and confirmed nudges still don’t register; registry entries continue to miss the pane IDs despite harness debug logging.

**Next Actions**
- Investigate why `launcher_handle.pane_id` is empty for synthetic entries (verify tmux output handling or string escaping) before rerunning the scenario.
- Add explicit pane cleanup when KEEP_SESSION=0 completes, so repeated runs don’t accumulate stale panes even if the monitor loop exits abnormally.

## 2025-10-21 07:10:37 UTC
**Objectives**
- Stop the runaway harness loops, capture why the monitor still isn’t nudging, and avoid leaving tmux panes behind during debugging.

**Work Performed**
- Added a harness-level timeout (`HARNESS_TIMEOUT`) and optional persistent monitor log path so synthetic runs terminate after a fixed window instead of hanging indefinitely; cleanup now culls panes/sandboxes automatically on timeout.
- Patched `agents-monitor-loop.sh` table parsing to tolerate prefix markers (`!`, `^`, `?`) and keep the handle column intact, then instrumented the alerts path (`MONITOR_DEBUG=1`) to dump the computed alert sets for inspection.
- Ran the harness twice with the new timeout (60 s) and confirmed panes were cleaned up automatically; monitor logs now show alerts being detected but the Python helper still emits `IndexError` traces when handling stale cases, so nudges continue to be skipped.

**Next Actions**
- Fix the `investigate_alerts` Python helper so it handles empty log/runtime fields without raising `IndexError`, then re-run a short synthetic scenario to verify the nudge message appears and the worker logs “received nudge”.
- Once nudges succeed, drop the temporary debug logging and rerun the full expectation checks to ensure the harness exits cleanly without relying on the timeout safeguard.

## 2025-10-21 07:44:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Stabilise the monitor loop so the synthetic harness exits without human intervention and expectation checks pass.

**Work Performed**
- Patched `agents-monitor-loop.sh` to pass log paths into the Python helper, guard against parsing gaps, join payloads with a non-whitespace separator, and emit debug traces when enabled; the monitor now sends tmux nudges and logs responses without spurious `IndexError`s.
- Improved `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` by adding a harness timeout, exposing a persistent monitor log option, adding long-sleep heartbeats, ensuring the `await-prompt` worker records the received nudge, and preventing the fail case from spoofing a positive response; expectation parser now lower-cases events and derives case slugs from run IDs.
- Re-ran the harness (`HARNESS_TIMEOUT=120`) and confirmed it completes automatically with “Monitor scenario expectations satisfied.”; monitor log (`.parallelus/monitor_log.txt`) shows nudges and expected manual attention outcomes, no panes left behind.

**Next Actions**
- Strip the temporary `MONITOR_DEBUG` traces from `agents-monitor-loop.sh` once we finish analysis, and keep the harness timeout configurable (defaulting to 60s).
- Capture these fixes in the branch plan and prep follow-up automation (CI entry point, targeted test) before reverting debug knobs.

## 2025-10-21 20:31:49 UTC
**Objectives**
- Capture design notes for a future `HARNESS_MODE=real` so we have a durable reference before implementing it.

**Work Performed**
- Confirmed via `launch_subagent.sh` that real subagents already stream transcripts through `script -qa` into each sandbox’s `subagent.log`; closing the tmux pane terminates the wrapper script and therefore the Codex process.
- Documented requirements for a real-mode harness: scope limited to purpose-built prompts that mimic synthetic behaviours (sleep, heartbeat, prompt wait); credentials supplied via existing out-of-repo config; results recorded in the branch plan/progress logs pending a formal design addendum.
- Noted that real mode will be opt-in only (no CI invocation) and depends on the existing monitor cleanup paths; logging/telemetry will reuse the current subagent registry plus monitor snapshots.

**Next Actions**
- Flesh out the real-mode harness prompts and operator guidance so the new script can be exercised end-to-end, then capture follow-up automation tasks in the branch plan.

## 2025-10-24 18:17:18 UTC
**Objectives**
- Implement the real-mode monitor harness and wire it into the test wrapper so future runs exercise the production flow.

**Work Performed**
- Authored `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-real.sh`, which launches deterministic real-mode subagents, drives `make monitor_subagents` with 15/30/300 thresholds, inspects deliverables/transcripts, and force-cleans sandboxes. The script requires `HARNESS_MODE=real` and emits per-scenario summaries.
- Replaced `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_real_scenario.sh` with a thin wrapper that simply invokes the production harness, keeping tests and operators on the same path.

**Next Actions**
- Fill in production-ready prompt language and document the operator workflow (deliverable checks, log review, escalation) before enabling the harness outside ad-hoc runs.

**Summary**
- summary

**Artifacts**
- TODO: list touched files.

**Next Actions**
- [ ] TODO: follow-up

## 2025-10-25 12:40:14 UTC
**Objectives**
- Kick off the real-mode monitor harness validation while complying with guardrails.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` at session start and launched session `20251023-20251025124002-e6b2c6` via `make start_session` to capture context.
- Confirmed plan alignment by re-reading `docs/plans/feature-claude-review.md` before executing real-mode test actions.

**Next Actions**
- Run `HARNESS_MODE=real tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_real_scenario.sh` and document results plus key log excerpts.

## 2025-10-25 13:04:20 UTC
**Objectives**
- Diagnose the stalled real-mode harness run without cleaning up live sandboxes.

**Work Performed**
- Inspected `docs/agents/subagent-registry.json` to confirm four active real-mode entries plus the earlier synthetic fixtures still marked `running`.
- Tailed `.parallelus/subagents/sandboxes/real-interactive-success-08lBr0/subagent.log`; observed the monitor-injected `Proceed` text landing in the Codex prompt without being submitted.
- Ran a single-iteration `make monitor_subagents` (timeout-limited) to capture the monitor’s current view; verified the loop still sees all four real-mode subagents as `running` and is repeatedly nudging them while flagging stale synthetic IDs.
- Captured pane IDs from `tmux list-panes -a` and sent `C-c` to `%276` (20251025-124253-real-interactive-success) to stop the repeated “89% context left” prompts without closing the pane or cleaning the sandbox.
- Patched `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-real.sh` to (a) refuse to relaunch scenarios already marked running, (b) record entry metadata, and (c) reconcile each run by harvesting, verifying, and optionally cleaning up via `subagent_manager`.
- Dry-ran the harness with `HARNESS_MODE=real KEEP_SANDBOX=1` to confirm it now aborts immediately when lingering `real-interactive-success` entries are still marked running; no existing panes were touched.
- Cleaned up the three stuck real-mode sandboxes by harvesting, forcing cleanup, and closing their tmux panes; noted the sandbox README gap that blocks `verify`.
- Updated `agents-monitor-loop.sh` so monitor nudges send two `Enter` keystrokes after the message, ensuring the injected “Proceed” actually submits instead of sitting in the compose buffer.
- Accidental re-run of the harness launched `20251026-143853/143855`; immediately harvested/forced-cleaned those sandboxes and killed panes `%283/%284`.
- Verified the revised nudge sequence manually: sending `Ctrl+U`, then `Proceed`+`Enter` commits the prompt; codified the same behavior in `agents-monitor-loop.sh` via a `NUDGE_CLEAR` option (enabled by default).
- Updated `agents-monitor-loop.sh` nudges to send the message with bracketed paste (`ESC [200~ ... ESC [201~`) so the injected command submits in a single pass.
- Configured subagent launcher to export `CODEX_TUI_RECORD_SESSION=1` and write structured transcripts to `subagent.session.jsonl` inside each sandbox.
- Added helper scripts `.agents/bin/subagent_tail.sh` (structured log tails) and `.agents/bin/subagent_send_keys.sh` (safe bracketed-paste nudge) and updated the subagent orchestration manual to make parent agents use them.
- Configured subagent launcher to export `CODEX_TUI_RECORD_SESSION=1` and write structured transcripts to `subagent.session.jsonl` inside each sandbox.
- With the monitor paused, manually experimented on pane `%282`: observed that `Ctrl+U` alone does not clear existing prompt text; `Ctrl+C` clears the buffer but exits if nothing is pending, so it’s unsafe.

**Next Actions**
- Explain duplicate `real-interactive-success` launches and capture log tail findings for the maintainer before making any further adjustments.

## 2025-10-26 18:55:41 UTC
**Objectives**
- Re-run the real-mode monitor harness, confirm stuck registry entries are cleared, and capture why runtime/log thresholds are not meeting expectations.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` and `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` at session start, then launched session `20251024-20251026182015-c79434` (`SESSION_PROMPT="real-mode monitor validation 2025-10-26"`).
- Ran `HARNESS_MODE=real tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_real_scenario.sh`; launch aborted on the pre-existing `20251026-023914-real-hung-failure` registry entry, so I inspected its sandbox (`real-hung-failure-nAPbCO`) and confirmed the Codex process was gone while the pane handle `%282/@66` remained.
- Forced cleanup via `subagent_manager.sh cleanup --id 20251026-023914-real-hung-failure --force`, documenting that the sandbox already contained logs and plan/progress artefacts for post-mortem review.
- Relaunched the harness which spawned `20251026-182021-real-interactive-success` and `20251026-182023-real-slow-progress`; monitored their panes (`%290`/`%291`) and collected JSON tail output with `subagent_tail.sh`.
- Observed the interactive scenario pause awaiting `ACK`; runtime alerts fired at ~6m45s but log-age remained <90s until the script stopped printing heartbeats. Manually injected `ACK` with `subagent_send_keys.sh --id … --text "ACK"` to let the script create `deliverables/.complete` before shutdown.
- Verified the slow-progress script completed its ten iterations and left a clean working tree; noted that spinner repaint noise keeps `subagent.log` mtimes fresh, delaying the log-age alarm long past the final command output.
- Harvest step was skipped because the harness exiting early left entries marked `pending`; per your instruction to proceed with cleanup I ran `subagent_manager.sh cleanup --force` for both new sandboxes, which removed the panes but also eliminated the deliverable for later inspection.
- Confirmed the registry now shows only historical entries plus older synthetic fixtures; captured monitor output demonstrating runtime alerts firing but log alerts lagging.

**Next Actions**
- Patch the harness workflow so we can launch a single scenario (interactive, slow-progress, or hung) independently and leave the sandbox intact until a post-mortem is recorded.
- Adjust the log-age heuristic to read the structured `subagent.session.jsonl` transcript (or tmux snapshot mtimes) instead of `subagent.log`, whose spinner repaint traffic masks inactivity.
- Add an explicit harvest/verify gating step before cleanup so deliverables are copied into the repo (or archived) prior to tearing down the sandbox.
- Update the branch plan to reflect the sequential scenario/post-mortem workflow and capture the follow-up defects (log-threshold blind spot, spinner noise, premature cleanup).

## 2025-10-26 19:45:32 UTC
**Objectives**
- Investigate lingering subagent panes, correct the interactive ACK flow, and harden the real-mode harness/monitor logic.

**Work Performed**
- Captured pane transcripts and session logs for `20251026-192220-real-interactive-success` and the aborted rerun (`20251026-193931`), storing them under `docs/guardrails/runs/...` for post-mortem analysis.
- Terminated the two live panes (`%297`, `%298`) via `tmux-safe kill-pane` only after harvesting logs and forcing registry cleanup (`subagent_manager.sh cleanup --force`), leaving no sandboxes under `.parallelus/subagents/sandboxes`.
- Updated the interactive scope to stop using the helper script; operators now print the ready line and call `read -r response` manually, leaving the prompt blocked until the parent injects `ACK`.
- Extended the real harness evaluation to flag any session command that types `ACK` directly and to run in single-scenario mode with optional autoreconcile/cleanup flags; signal handling now leaves launched IDs listed instead of silently nuking them.
- Reworked `subagent_manager status` and the monitor loop to derive log ages from `subagent.session.jsonl`, ignoring Codex spinner `CommitTick` noise so stale prompts trigger the log threshold.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run the interactive scenario end-to-end (single-scenario mode) to confirm the parent-injected `ACK` is required and that log alerts fire using the new transcript-based timestamps.
- Patch evaluation to record the post-injection `deliverable recorded` line as proof of success once the parent acknowledgement path is validated.
- Document the redesigned workflow in the branch plan and guardrail manuals so reviewers understand the manual ACK handshake and new harness flags.

## 2025-10-26 20:15:18 UTC
**Objectives**
- Diagnose the instant-ACK behaviour and confirm why log-threshold alerts still failed during the latest interactive run.

**Work Performed**
- Kopied all artefacts from sandbox `real-interactive-success-PgdP47` into `docs/guardrails/runs/20251026-195718-real-interactive-success/` before forcing cleanup, ensuring we have the transcript that shows the immediate ACK and later idle prompt.
- Reviewed the transcript: the subagent streamed the “Ready…” line and full status report in a single message, then the harness’ auto-ACK helper fired immediately because `REAL_AUTO_ACK` was still enabled. After the summary finished the pane sat idle, proving the prompt really was waiting even though no log alert fired.
- Confirmed the log-age calculation still fell back to `subagent.log`, whose tmux repaint noise kept the mtime fresh; patched the monitor and manager helpers so the presence of `subagent.session.jsonl` completely overrides the raw log.
- Removed the auto-ACK helper from `agents-monitor-real.sh`, ensuring future runs require an explicit `subagent_send_keys` call (triggered by the monitor or operator) once the idle prompt is detected.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run the interactive scenario with auto-ACK disabled to verify the monitor now detects the idle state and that the ACK must come from the parent agent.
- Adjust evaluation to double-check the ready message precedes the ACK and that deliverables appear only after the parent injects it; update plan/docs once the new flow is validated.

## 2025-10-26 21:40:12 UTC
**Objectives**
- Capture evidence from the 20:26 and 20:47 interactive runs and fix the monitor loop so log-age alerts stop the harness instead of looping silently.

**Work Performed**
- Archived transcripts/logs for runs `20251026-202947` and `20251026-204721` under `docs/guardrails/runs/` before force-cleaning their panes (`%301`, `%302`).
- Noted the 20:27 run still produced no deliverables—ACK never arrived—which confirms auto-ACK is gone but the harness kept looping because `agents-monitor-loop.sh` swallowed non-zero statuses.
- Patched the monitor loop to surface `make monitor_subagents` output, track alert status (using `OVERALL_ALERT`), and exit with code 1 when log/runtime thresholds are breached; also added wrappers so `agents-monitor-real.sh` now halts instead of hiding alerts.
- Reset tmux to a single main pane (`%300`) ahead of the next attempt.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run the interactive scenario with the updated monitor loop to confirm the alert shows up after ~90 s and the harness exits, allowing us to inject `ACK` manually.
- Once verified, proceed with the deliverable creation and update plan/docs accordingly.

## 2025-10-26 21:55:42 UTC
**Objectives**
- Complete the interactive scenario end-to-end now that the monitor halts on the log alert, ensuring the parent agent injects the required ACK, harvests the deliverable, and archives evidence.

**Work Performed**
- Launched `HARNESS_MODE=real … --scenario interactive-success --reconcile`; monitor stopped after ~2½ minutes with `requires manual attention (reason: log)`, confirming the idle prompt was detected.
- Injected `ACK` via `.agents/bin/subagent_send_keys.sh --id 20251026-213829-real-interactive-success --text "ACK"`; observed the subagent produce `deliverables/result.txt`, `.manifest`, and `.complete`.
- Harvested the deliverable (moved to `docs/guardrails/runs/20251026-213829-real-interactive-success/result.txt`), archived the transcript/log there, and forced cleanup of the sandbox/pane.
- Updated the monitor loop to exit with non-zero status when alerts occur (`OVERALL_ALERT`), so future runs can bail out immediately without manual interruptions.

**Next Actions**
- Fold the single-scenario runbook into the plan, then expand to the remaining real-mode scenarios with the same manual-alert workflow.
- Document the final parent-agent steps (respond-to-log-alert → send ACK → harvest → cleanup) in the guardrail manual and branch plan.

## 2025-10-26 22:02:44 UTC
**Objectives**
- Execute the interactive scenario with the new alert flow, confirm the monitor stops for the log-age breach, inject ACK, and run the harvest/resume steps in the documented order.

**Work Performed**
- Ran `HARNESS_MODE=real … --scenario interactive-success --reconcile`; monitor tripped the 30s log threshold and exited with `[monitor] … requires manual attention (reason: log)` exactly as expected.
- Sent ACK via `subagent_send_keys.sh`, watched the subagent create `deliverables/result.txt` and companions, then harvested them into `docs/guardrails/runs/20251026-215503-real-interactive-success/`.
- Re-ran `agents-monitor-loop.sh` (single-iteration) after the deliverable step; it now exits cleanly with `deliverables harvested` and no outstanding alerts, validating the complete flow.
- Force-cleaned the sandbox/pane and archived the session transcript/log for audit.

**Next Actions**
- Generalize the same monitor/alert workflow to the remaining real-mode scenarios (slow-progress, hung-failure), then update the guardrail docs and plan with the finalized procedure.
- Capture today’s monitor/response fixes:
  - `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh` now tracks alert state and exits non-zero when manual attention is needed.
  - `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-real.sh` surfaces monitor output and stops once alerts fire.
  - `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scopes/interactive_success.md` no longer hard-codes the string to send; it just waits for the reviewer’s response.
  - `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` now documents the repeatable cycle (monitor → respond → resume) and the “archive in branch, drop before merge” rule.
  - Session artefacts for runs `20251026-213829`, `20251026-215503`, and `20251026-221723` live in `docs/guardrails/runs/<id>/` for audit.

## 2025-10-26 22:45:30 UTC
**Objectives**
- Extend the interactive real-mode scenario to introduce post-ACK delay buffers and document the correct shutdown workflow after harvesting deliverables.

**Work Performed**
- Edited `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/interactive_success.sh` so the sandbox waits 60 s after receiving `ACK` before emitting deliverables and another 60 s before signalling completion, providing explicit log markers for each delay.
- Updated `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` with guidance instructing maintainers to rerun the monitor loop, call `subagent_manager.sh cleanup`, and, if necessary, `tmux kill-pane` instead of typing `exit` to close a lingering pane.
- Archived the latest interactive run artefacts under `docs/guardrails/runs/20251026-223220-real-interactive-success/` and removed the throwaway sandbox, then killed tmux pane `codex-parallelus:0.1` to leave the session clean.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run the interactive real-mode scenario to validate the new 60 s buffers and capture the longer idle window in the progress log.
- Share the shutdown guidance with maintainers reviewing ongoing monitor runs so pane cleanup stays consistent across operators.

## 2025-10-26 23:12:57 UTC
**Objectives**
- Reduce unnecessary document reads during bootstrap so subagents conserve context.

**Work Performed**
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to emphasise that read-on-trigger manuals must only be opened after their gate fires and to narrow `.agents` scanning to the project’s custom README unless it explicitly calls for more material.

**Next Actions**
- Monitor upcoming subagent runs to confirm the tightened guidance prevents redundant manual reads without breaking guardrail coverage.

## 2025-10-26 23:20:10 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate the revised guidance during a fresh interactive run and automate transcript capture for future audits.

**Work Performed**
- Re-ran the interactive real-mode scenario (`HARNESS_MODE=real … --scenario interactive-success --reconcile`), injected `ACK`, and harvested the deliverable plus session artefacts under `docs/guardrails/runs/20251026-231429-real-interactive-success/`.
- Enhanced `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/interactive_success.sh` to emit heartbeats during both 60-second buffers and updated the scope so subagents call the helper instead of idling with raw sleeps.
- Authored `.agents/bin/subagent_session_to_transcript.py` and documented it in `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` so every run now produces a human-readable Markdown transcript alongside `session.jsonl`.

**Next Actions**
- Exercise the slow-progress and hung-failure scenarios to verify their scripts still meet the updated guardrail expectations.

## 2025-10-26 23:33:46 UTC
**Objectives**
- Confirm the updated scope actually drives the helper script (and heartbeats) during a live interactive run.

**Work Performed**
- Launched another `HARNESS_MODE=real … --scenario interactive-success --reconcile`; since the script changes were still uncommitted, the sandbox pulled the previous helper (no streaming heartbeats). Run artefacts captured under `docs/guardrails/runs/20251026-232622-real-interactive-success/` plus the generated transcript for baseline comparison.

**Next Actions**
- Commit the helper/script updates, then re-run the scenario once more to confirm the new heartbeat behaviour surfaces in-session.

## 2025-10-27 00:02:14 UTC
**Objectives**
- Verify the committed helper produces streaming heartbeats and capture follow-on documentation needs.

**Work Performed**
- Re-ran the interactive scenario after pushing the helper updates; the subagent now produces heartbeats every 10 s through both 60-second windows (`docs/guardrails/runs/20251026-234820-real-interactive-success/`).
- Noted that the scope still leaves ordering ambiguous (guardrail review vs. readiness message), so we plan to clarify the sequence (guardrails → bootstrap → notebooks → readiness message → helper) in both the scope and plan template.

**Next Actions**
- Update `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scopes/interactive_success.md` and the plan template so subagents perform guardrail review and bootstrap before posting the readiness message, and highlight the helper script as the post-ACK action.

## 2025-10-27 01:08:43 UTC
**Objectives**
- Clarify the bootstrap sequence directly in the interactive-success scope so subagents stop reordering tasks.

**Work Performed**
- Amended `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scopes/interactive_success.md` with a preamble instructing subagents to run `make read_bootstrap`, review guardrails, execute `make bootstrap`, and update plan/progress notebooks before posting the readiness message; step 3 now explicitly frames the helper script as the only post-ACK action.

**Next Actions**
- Monitor the next real-mode run to confirm the clarified scope removes the guardrail/plan conflict noted earlier.
