# Branch Progress — feature-claude-review

## 2025-10-27 20:58:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Restore branch notebooks and outline the guardrail follow-up work.

**Work Performed**
- Recreated the branch plan/progress notebooks to resume logging.
- Captured the new objective: allow doc-only commits between review and merge.

## 2025-10-27 21:40:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Allow benign documentation changes after the senior architect review without rerunning the review.

**Work Performed**
- Updated `agents-merge` to permit any number of post-review commits provided all touched files live in guardrail-safe paths.
- Added regression tests (`.agents/tests/test_agents_merge_benign.py`) covering both allowed and disallowed scenarios.
- Documented the new behaviour in `docs/agents/git-workflow.md` and reran `make ci` to validate the change.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run the senior architect review on commit 626e72c69eeb53c6bcfb65b53ccf9597d5011c88 before merging.
- Monitor upcoming merges to ensure the benign-diff guardrail works as intended.

## 2025-10-27 23:23:08 UTC
**Objectives**
- Address senior-review blockers (tmux-safe nudges, archive guardrail, monitor defaults).

**Work Performed**
- Routed nudge helper calls through `.agents/bin/tmux-safe`, ensured archive failures abort cleanup, and aligned monitor usage defaults.
- Added review-file commit verification before cleanup and reran the senior architect review (pending approval).
- `make ci` and `.agents/tests/monitor_loop.py` now pass with the updated scripts.

**Next Actions**
- Harvest the approved senior architect review and proceed with merge once satisfied.

## 2025-10-27 23:42:15 UTC
**Objectives**
- Capture the cleanup best practice for senior-review subagents.

**Work Performed**
- Documented the post-review shutdown sequence (harvest → verify hash → monitor clean exit → subagent cleanup) in `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`.
- Closed the lingering senior-review pane after `cleanup --force` and noted the pattern to avoid repeats.

**Next Actions**
- Finish the current senior-review run and ensure all panes are closed before merging.
