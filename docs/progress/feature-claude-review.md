# Branch Progress — feature-claude-review

## 2025-10-27 20:58:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Restore branch notebooks and outline the guardrail follow-up work.

**Work Performed**
- Recreated the branch plan/progress notebooks to resume logging.
- Captured the new objective: allow doc-only commits between review and merge.

## 2025-10-27 21:40:00 UTC
**Objectives**
- Allow benign documentation changes after the senior architect review without rerunning the review.

**Work Performed**
- Updated `agents-merge` to permit any number of post-review commits provided all touched files live in guardrail-safe paths.
- Added regression tests (`.agents/tests/test_agents_merge_benign.py`) covering both allowed and disallowed scenarios.
- Documented the new behaviour in `docs/agents/git-workflow.md` and reran `make ci` to validate the change.

**Next Actions**
- Re-run the senior architect review on commit 626e72c69eeb53c6bcfb65b53ccf9597d5011c88 before merging.
- Monitor upcoming merges to ensure the benign-diff guardrail works as intended.

## 2025-10-27 23:23:08 UTC
**Objectives**
- Address senior-review blockers (tmux-safe nudges, archive guardrail, monitor defaults).

**Work Performed**
- Routed nudge helper calls through `.agents/bin/tmux-safe`, ensured archive failures abort cleanup, and aligned monitor usage defaults.
- Added review-file commit verification before cleanup and reran the senior architect review (pending approval).
- `make ci` and `.agents/tests/monitor_loop.py` now pass with the updated scripts.

**Next Actions**
- Harvest the approved senior architect review and proceed with merge once satisfied.

## 2025-10-27 23:42:15 UTC
**Objectives**
- Capture the cleanup best practice for senior-review subagents.

**Work Performed**
- Documented the post-review shutdown sequence (harvest → verify hash → monitor clean exit → subagent cleanup) in `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`.
- Closed the lingering senior-review pane after `cleanup --force` and noted the pattern to avoid repeats.

**Next Actions**
- Finish the current senior-review run and ensure all panes are closed before merging.

## 2025-10-27 23:47:49 UTC
**Objectives**
- Reconcile the latest senior-review subagent run and address its findings.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` and `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` to confirm current guardrails before executing new commands.
- Inspected the sandbox `senior-review-kEZuFt` and compared the unharvested review with the repository copy.
- Recorded session context with `SESSION_PROMPT="Harvest senior review" make start_session`.

**Next Actions**
- Harvest the updated review report, clean up the subagent sandbox, and fix the monitor loop regression plus missing test coverage.

## 2025-10-27 23:59:18 UTC
**Objectives**
- Land the pending senior-review deliverable and close out the identified monitor-loop regressions.

**Work Performed**
- Copied the `senior-review-kEZuFt` review artefact into `docs/reviews/feature-claude-review-2025-10-27.md`, archived the session under `docs/guardrails/runs/20251027-232707-senior-review-kEZuFt/`, and deleted the orphaned sandbox directory.
- Updated `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh` so failed `subagent_send_keys` nudges log a manual-attention warning without exiting under `set -euo pipefail`.
- Extended `.agents/tests/monitor_loop.py` with a `nudge-failure` fixture that stubs `subagent_send_keys.sh`, `tmux-safe`, and the registry to verify the failure path.
- Ran `python3 -m pytest .agents/tests/monitor_loop.py -q` to confirm the guardrail suite passes with the new coverage.

**Next Actions**
- Communicate the harvested review status, highlight the blocker resolution, and decide whether a follow-up senior review is required after committing the fixes.

## 2025-10-28 00:04:15 UTC
**Objectives**
- Relaunch the senior architect review on the post-fix commit with full gate compliance.

**Work Performed**
- Re-read `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` to refresh the subagent guardrails ahead of the new review run.
- Captured renewed session context via `SESSION_PROMPT="Rerun senior review" make start_session` for auditability.

**Next Actions**
- Update scope/plan details as needed and launch the senior-review subagent for the current HEAD.

## 2025-10-28 00:17:13 UTC
**Objectives**
- Reconcile branch state after aborting the attempted rebase and confirm readiness for the refreshed senior review.

**Work Performed**
- Documented the rebase attempt/abort (conflict with the previous approved review) and verified the branch sits at `fix: keep monitor loop alive on nudge failures` while tracking a single remote commit behind (`e536680`).

**Next Actions**
- Launch the senior architect subagent against the current HEAD and gather the updated review.
