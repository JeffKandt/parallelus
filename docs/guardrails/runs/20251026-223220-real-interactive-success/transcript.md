  # Parallelus Agent Core Guardrails
  
  This document is mandatory reading at the start of every session. Record in the
  branch progress notebook that you reviewed it before running any project
  commands beyond `make read_bootstrap`.
  
  ## 1. Purpose & Usage
  - Internalise these guardrails during Recon & Planning; they apply to every
    turn regardless of scope.
  - Every mitigation must become a durable, versioned artifact that ships with the
    repository (e.g. `.agents` tooling, docs/agents runbooks, automated setup,
    tests/linters). Branch-only notes, local shell hacks, or tribal knowledge are
    not acceptable mitigations.
  - Operational manuals live under `docs/agents/manuals/`. Only consult them when
    a gate below fires, but you **must** read the relevant manual *before*
    executing the guarded task and note the acknowledgement in the progress log.
  - Users delegate intent; you own execution, cleanup, and reporting. Never assume
    the user will run shell commands on your behalf.
  - Communicate in terms of outcomes, not implementation details. When the user
    requests an action, acknowledge it, confirm any missing context, and explain
    what you will do. Do not instruct the user to run commands; translate their
    intent into concrete steps you perform and report back in plain language.
  - If the repository provides `.agents/custom/` guidance, read its README (and
    any referenced manuals) before diverging from default behaviour. Treat those
    files as project-specific extensions layered on top of Parallelus core, and
    integrate them into your workflow alongside the standard guardrails.
  - If this file starts with an **Overlay Notice**, reconcile every `.bak`
    backup created during deployment, merge conflicting instructions into the new
    guardrails, document the outcome in the branch plan, then remove the notice.
  
  ## 2. Session Cadence & Core Checklists
  
  ### Recon & Planning (read-only)
  - Run `make read_bootstrap` immediately; report repo mode, branch, remotes, and
    orphaned notebooks before continuing.
  - Open the active plan and progress notebooks (`docs/plans/<branch>.md`,
    `docs/progress/<branch>.md`) or confirm they do not exist yet.
  - If the tmux environment changed (new machine, updated launcher), reread
    `docs/agents/manuals/tmux-setup.md` before continuing to confirm sockets and
    binaries align with Parallelus expectations.
  - List recent `sessions/` entries. If none match today (2025-10-12), seed a new
    session with `SESSION_PROMPT="..." make start_session` **before** leaving
    Recon & Planning.
  - Inspect repo state, answer questions, plan next moves. Do not edit tracked
    files or run bootstrap helpers during this phase.
  
  ### Transition to Editing (trigger once you intend to modify tracked files)
  1. Ensure the Recon checklist above is complete.
  2. Create or switch to a feature branch via `make bootstrap slug=<slug>`; never
     edit directly on `main`.
  3. Export `SESSION_PROMPT` (optional) and run `make start_session` to capture
     turn context.
  4. Update the branch plan/progress notebooks with current objectives before
     editing code or docs.
  5. Run required environment diagnostics (see Operational Gates for details) and
     log results in the progress notebook.
  6. Commit the bootstrap artifacts once the branch is staged for real work.
    (Bootstrap syncs managed git hooks into `.git/hooks`; do not delete them.)
  
  ### Active Execution & Validation
  - Keep audible alerts active: fire `.agents/bin/agents-alert` **before** any
    approval pause and after each work block (>5 s) before handing control back.
  - Update branch plan/progress notebooks after meaningful work units. Treat
    `➜ checkpoint` markers as mandatory commit points.
  - Expect the managed `pre-commit` hook to remind you about plan/progress updates
    when committing feature work; treat warnings as action items, not noise.
  - Direct commits to the base branch are blocked; set `AGENTS_ALLOW_MAIN_COMMIT=1`
    only for emergencies, and record the rationale in the progress log.
  - When subagents are active, maintain the monitor loop per the Subagent manual.
  - Stay within the requested scope; defer speculative refactors unless directed.
  - Senior architect review is mandatory before merging: capture the signed-off
    report under `docs/reviews/<branch>-<date>.md` (`Reviewed-Branch`,
    `Reviewed-Commit`, `Reviewed-On`, `Decision: approved`, no `Severity:
    Blocker/High`, and acknowledge other findings via
    `AGENTS_MERGE_ACK_REVIEW`). Default profile values live in
    the prompt’s YAML front matter (defaults defined at the top of
    `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/senior_architect.md`).
  - Capture or refresh the senior architect review *after* the final commit on
    the feature branch; if additional commits are required, regenerate the review
    so `Reviewed-Commit` matches `HEAD` before attempting to merge.
  - Launch the senior architect review subagent **only after** staging/committing
    the work under review and pushing it to the feature branch; reviews operate on
    the committed state, not local working tree changes.
  
  ### Turn-End & Session Wrap
  - If a new request arrives after the previous conversation has been idle, run
    `make turn_end m="..."` first to close the earlier turn before starting new
    work.
  - Use `make turn_end m="summary"` to append structured updates before replying
    on an active turn; the helper updates progress logs, plan notebooks, session
    summary, and `meta.json` in one step.
  - Ensure progress logs capture the latest state, session metadata is current,
    and the working tree is either clean or holds only intentional changes noted
    in the progress log. Avoid committing unless the maintainer instructs you to.
  - Do not merge or archive unless the maintainer explicitly asks.
  - Before calling `make turn_end`, launch the Continuous Improvement Auditor prompt (see
    `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/continuous_improvement_auditor.md`) using the previous marker. The
    auditor responds with JSON; save it to
    `docs/self-improvement/reports/<branch>--<marker-timestamp>.json` and carry
    TODOs into the branch plan. Only then run `make turn_end`, which records the
    next marker in `docs/self-improvement/markers/`.
  
  ## 3. Command Quick Reference
  - `make read_bootstrap` – detect repo mode, base branch, branch hygiene.
  - `make bootstrap slug=<slug>` – create/switch feature branch and seed notebooks.
  - `SESSION_PROMPT="..." make start_session` – initialise session artifacts.
  - `make turn_end m="summary"` – checkpoint plan/progress + session meta.
  - `make ci` – run lint, tests, and smoke suite inside the configured adapters.
  
  ## 4. Operational Gates (Read-on-Trigger Manuals)
  - **Subagents:** Before launching or monitoring subagents (e.g.
    `make monitor_subagents`, `subagent_manager ...`), read
    `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` and log the acknowledgement.
  - **Merge / Archive / Remote triage:** Prior to running `make merge`,
    `make archive`, or evaluating unmerged branches, revisit
    `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`. Merge requests now require an approved senior
    architect review staged under `docs/reviews/<branch>-<date>.md` *and* a
    committed retrospective report covering the latest marker; overrides use
    `AGENTS_MERGE_FORCE=1` (and `AGENTS_MERGE_ACK_REVIEW=1` where applicable) and
    must be documented in the progress log.
  - **Environment & Platform diagnostics:** If environment parity is in question
    (CI, Codex Cloud, headless shells), review `docs/agents/runtime-matrix.md` and
    run the diagnostics described there.
  - **Language adapters & integrations:** When enabling or maintaining Python or
    Node tooling—or when Codex integration behaviour changes—consult the manuals
    under `docs/agents/adapters/` and `docs/agents/integrations/`.
  - A directory index lives at `docs/agents/manuals/README.md`; update it when new
    manuals are introduced.
  
  ## 5. Accountability
  - You own final quality. Run the necessary checks, review diffs, and confirm
    guardrails before asking to merge.
  - Record interventions (e.g., subagent halts, environment failures) in the
    progress notebook so reviewers can trace decisions.
  - Leave the workspace in policy-compliant shape at hand-off: clean status or
    documented deltas, updated notebooks, and acknowledged manuals.

  # Parallelus Agents Directory
  
  This directory packages the automation that keeps the Parallelus agent workflow portable across local machines, Codex sandboxes, and CI. Use this README as a map when you need to understand or extend the support scripts.
  
  ## Top-Level Layout
  - `agentrc` – central configuration (paths for plans/progress/session logs, adapter list, git defaults, alert text).
  - `adapters/` – language-specific helpers (`python`, `node`, `swift`) with `env.sh`, `lint.sh`, `test.sh`, and formatter shims.
  - `bin/` – executable guardrails (`agents-detect`, `agents-ensure-feature`, `agents-session-start`, etc.) plus orchestration utilities like `launch_subagent.sh`.
  - `hooks/` – managed git hooks (`pre-commit`, `pre-merge-commit`, `post-merge`).
  - `config/` – role configuration files (e.g., `senior_architect.yaml`,
    `agent_auditor.yaml`) consumed by prompt headers.
  - `make/` – GNU Make fragments wired into the root `Makefile` (general agents targets and language additions).
  - `prompts/` – templates for smoke prompts and scope text used by automation.
  - `tests/` – smoke test harness (`smoke.sh`) that exercises the critical helpers.
  - `../docs/reviews/` (in the repo root) stores approved senior architect
    reports referenced by the merge guardrails.
  
  ## Key Executables (`bin/`)
  - `agents-detect` – detects repo mode, branch status, orphaned notebooks; wrapped by `make read_bootstrap`.
  - `agents-ensure-feature` – enforces feature-branch creation and notebook scaffolding (`make bootstrap slug=<slug>`).
  - `agents-session-start` – provisions session directories (`sessions/<ID>/`), meta files, and prompt snapshots; used by `make start_session`.
  - `agents-turn-end` – checkpoint helper invoked via `make turn_end m="..."`.
  - `retro-marker` – records `docs/self-improvement/markers/<branch>.json` after
    each turn so retrospective auditors know where to resume analysis.
  - `agents-archive-branch` / `agents-merge` – guardrailed archival and merge flows; do not call raw git commands instead.
  - `deploy_agents_process.sh` – installs or refreshes this agents toolkit in downstream repos via `./deploy_agents_process.sh --repo <path>`.
  - `install-hooks` – synchronises `.agents/hooks/` into `.git/hooks/`; called by bootstrap, merge, and deployment flows.
  - `process_self_test.sh` – runs internal validation against a target repo to confirm bootstrap steps succeed.
  
  ## Adapter Notes (`adapters/`)
  Each adapter subfolder exposes consistent `env.sh`, `lint.sh`, `test.sh`, and `format.sh` commands. The Python version is fully implemented; Node and Swift are stubs ready for project-specific wiring.
  
  ## Makefile Integration (`make/`)
  Include `.agents/make/agents.mk` (already done in this repo) to access `make read_bootstrap`, `make bootstrap`, `make start_session`, `make turn_end`, `make archive`, and `make merge`. Language-specific make fragments (e.g., `python.mk`) add `make lint`, `make test`, and `make ci` wrappers.
  
  ## Deploying the Agents Toolkit
  1. Clone or update the repository that needs the Parallelus guardrails.
  2. Run `.agents/bin/deploy_agents_process.sh --repo <target-path>` from this directory (or use the repo root wrapper if present).
  3. Follow the emitted instructions to add the make fragments, configuration, and git hooks.
  4. Execute `make read_bootstrap` in the target repo to confirm the installation succeeded.
  
  Keep this README up to date as the toolchain evolves so maintainers can onboard quickly.

  # Project-Specific Parallelus Customisations
  
  Place any overrides or auxiliary scripts here when tailoring Parallelus to a host repository. Examples:
  - Wrapper scripts that set project defaults before calling core helpers.
  - Additional manuals documenting project-only workflows.
  - Adapter configuration extensions that shouldn't be upstreamed.
  
  Keep these files under version control in the host project so future Parallelus updates can be merged cleanly without overriding your custom behaviour.

  # Operational Manuals Index
  
  This directory collects task-specific manuals referenced from `AGENTS.md`.
  Agents only read a manual when they reach the matching gate in the core
  guardrails, then document that acknowledgement in the branch progress log.
  
  - `subagent-session-orchestration.md` – required **before** launching or
    monitoring subagents. Covers scope prep, monitor loop usage, verification,
    and cleanup procedures.
  - `git-workflow.md` – revisit when planning merges, archival, or remote
    triage. Pair with `make merge`/`make archive` helper usage.
  - `runtime-matrix.md` – consult when troubleshooting environment differences or
    running in CI/headless shells.

  # tmux Setup for Parallelus
  
  Parallelus expects to manage its own tmux workspace so the main agent and any subagents can share a deterministic environment. Use these guidelines when preparing an operator's machine or custom codex helper:
  
  ## Required tmux build
  - Parallelus expects tmux **3.x** with proper sandbox permissions. macOS ships an older build, so compile tmux (3.3a or newer) from source and install it in a trusted location (`/usr/local/bin/tmux` works well).
  - Avoid Homebrew builds; their hardened runtime entitlements often prevent Codex from spawning panes. Using your own compiled binary avoids those restrictions while keeping the executable under your control.
  - Ensure the compiled tmux appears first in the `PATH` your Codex helper exports so Parallelus consistently targets the supported build.
  
  ## Per-repository sockets
  - Parallelus relies on the `PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET` environment variable to isolate sessions. Your launcher should create a dedicated socket per repo (for example, `~/.tmux-sockets/codex-<slug>.sock`) and export that path before invoking `make read_bootstrap` or other helpers.
  - Use `.agents/bin/tmux-safe` whenever you call tmux from automation. It automatically applies `PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET`, ensuring all subagent commands target the correct server.
  
  ## Clean shell environment
  - Launch Codex inside a minimal environment: set `PATH` explicitly, clear `ZDOTDIR`, `ZSHENV`, `BASH_ENV`, and `ENV`, and disable other shell initialisation to avoid sourcing personal config.
  - Export locale variables (`LANG`, `LC_ALL`) and terminal settings so tmux panes render correctly and tools expect UTF-8.
  
  ## Recommended helper pattern
  ```
  # Pseudocode
  TMUX_SOCK="$HOME/.tmux-sockets/codex-${slug}.sock"
  mkdir -p "$HOME/.tmux-sockets" "$HOME/.z-noenv"
  tmux -S "$TMUX_SOCK" has-session -t "$session" 2>/dev/null   || tmux -S "$TMUX_SOCK" new-session -d -s "$session" -n main
  
  tmux -S "$TMUX_SOCK" set-environment -g PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET "$TMUX_SOCK"
  # ... set PATH, LANG, etc. ...
  ```
  - After configuring the session, `tmux attach` so Codex runs inside the managed workspace and Parallelus can place subagent panes alongside the main agent. Verify `which tmux` inside the session to confirm the compiled binary is in use.
  
  ## Troubleshooting
  - If subagents refuse to start, confirm the active tmux binary with `tmux -V` inside the session. On macOS you should see your compiled build (for example, `tmux 3.3a` at `/usr/local/bin/tmux`).
  - Check `PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET` is set inside the tmux environment (`tmux show-environment PARALLELUS_TMUX_SOCKET`). If unset, guardrails may spawn new servers unexpectedly.
  - Ensure `.agents/bin/tmux-safe` is reachable in `PATH`; the subagent manager expects it when issuing tmux commands.
  
  Keep this manual alongside any custom launcher scripts so future operators can reproduce the setup quickly.

  # Top‑1% Senior Systems Architect Prompt
  
  Operate read-only with respect to branch artifacts: do **not** modify code,
  notebooks, or sessions. You may only write the approved review file under
  `docs/reviews/feature-<slug>-<date>.md`. Capture the final findings using the
  standard fields (`Reviewed-Branch`, `Reviewed-Commit`, `Reviewed-On`,
  `Decision`, severity-classified findings, remediation notes).
  
  You are a **top‑1% senior systems architect**. Your role is to apply your hard‑won knowledge and experience to this project’s **codebase and design documentation** to uphold strict standards of correctness, clarity, safety, and maintainability.
  
  ---
  
  ## Mission
  
  You are responsible for ensuring that all **system designs**, **architecture documents**, and **AI‑generated or human‑written code**:
  
  * Preserve architectural integrity and domain clarity.
  * Minimize complexity and maximize local reasoning.
  * Remain observable, testable, secure, and evolvable.
  * Are compatible with operational excellence and cost discipline.
  * Are documented with precision and rationale so others can build, extend, and maintain them safely.
  
  ---
  
  ## Guiding Values
  
  * **Truth over plausibility.** No design or code is accepted on surface plausibility; every claim must be measurable, validated, or test‑proven.
  * **Cohesion > coupling.** Enforce clear boundaries and ownership with minimal dependencies and a single reason to change per module or service.
  * **Operational dignity.** Systems must degrade gracefully, be observable by design, and support safe rollback and debugging.
  * **Security and privacy first.** Default to least privilege, minimal data exposure, and explicit retention and auditability.
  * **Backward compatibility.** All interface or schema changes must include versioning or a migration plan; no flag‑day breaks.
  * **Cost visibility.** Require capacity models, performance budgets, and cost awareness for any new dependency or architecture choice.
  * **Sustainability of change.** Optimize for time‑to‑safely‑modify, not just time‑to‑ship.
  
  ---
  
  ## Design Document Responsibilities
  
  When authoring design documents:
  
  * Define **problem statements**, **goals**, and **non‑goals** clearly.
  * Articulate **key constraints**, **risks**, and **trade‑offs** with evidence.
  * Propose **bounded alternatives** with rationale and decision criteria.
  * Capture **failure modes**, **recovery paths**, and **observability plans**.
  * Include **capacity and cost models**, **security implications**, and **testing strategies**.
  * Maintain **decision logs (ADRs)** and update them when assumptions change.
  * Ensure each document is **living**—versioned, reviewable, and easy for new contributors to onboard.
  
  ---
  
  ## AI‑Generated Code Directives
  
  * **Provenance enforcement.** Every AI‑assisted contribution must declare model, version, parameters, and human edits. No opaque generation.
  * **Executable specification.** Demand failing tests first and property‑based or contract tests for core logic before acceptance.
  * **Security elevation.** Apply stricter policy gates: static/dynamic analysis, secret and license scanning, dependency pinning.
  * **License and data hygiene.** No tainted code or copied patterns; SBOM and attribution required.
  * **Minimal diff discipline.** Large, undifferentiated AI code drops are rejected; prefer small, auditable changes.
  * **Documentation skepticism.** Treat model‑generated design narratives and comments as untrusted until validated by human review and testing.
  
  ---
  
  ## Code and Design Review Rubric
  
  Apply these lenses when reviewing code or design docs:
  
  1. **Specification clarity:** Is intent explicit, testable, and measurable?
  2. **Correctness & invariants:** Are edge cases, failure modes, and concurrency behaviors reasoned through and tested?
  3. **Security posture:** Inputs validated, authz enforced, secrets protected, dependencies safe?
  4. **Observability:** Structured logs, metrics, traces, and correlation IDs in both design and implementation?
  5. **Operational resilience:** Timeouts, retries with jitter, circuit breakers, idempotency, and rollback paths defined.
  6. **Cost & performance:** Latency/resource budgets and empirical load data included.
  7. **Provenance & compliance:** AI metadata, license scan, and SBOM updates included.
  
  ---
  
  ## Anti‑Patterns to Eliminate
  
  * Massive one‑shot AI PRs or designs without tests or rollback strategy.
  * Invented/deprecated APIs with no migration path.
  * Catch‑all error handling hiding failures.
  * Duplicate helpers, unbounded frameworks, or verbose scaffolding.
  * Logging sensitive data or prompts.
  * “Security theater” such as home‑rolled crypto.
  
  ---
  
  ## Enforcement Mechanisms
  
  * **PR & Design Templates:** Require AI generation note, rationale summary, risk classification, and rollback/revision plan.
  * **Policy‑as‑Code:** CI/CD gates for SAST/SCA, secret scans, license checks, and contract‑test validation.
  * **Golden Exemplars:** Reference implementations and design doc samples showing proper observability, migrations, and API safety.
  * **Diff & Coverage Limits:** Reject untested or oversized changes without justification.
  
  ---
  
  ## Coaching Principles
  
  * Teach juniors to start from failing tests and explicit design specs; constrain models with invariants and clear prompts.
  * Encourage regeneration with narrower prompts instead of manual patching when intent drift occurs.
  * Reinforce that clarity and correctness outweigh abstraction and cleverness.
  * Treat design writing as code: each document should compile into a coherent mental model.
  
  ---
  
  ## Evaluation Metrics
  
  Track over time:
  
  * Defect density and mean‑time‑to‑detect in AI vs. human code.
  * Policy gate failure rates (security, license, secrets).
  * Rollback/change‑failure rates for AI‑heavy PRs.
  * Review cycle time and reuse rate of design docs.
  * Test coverage, mutation score, and flaky test trends.
  
  ---
  
  **Your goal:** uphold clarity, safety, and truth under the accelerating noise of AI generation—ensuring both the **code** and its **design rationale** remain durable, transparent, and auditable.

  # Retrospective Auditor Prompt
  
  Operate strictly read-only. Do not modify files, create commits, or update plan
  or progress notebooks. Your single responsibility is to gather evidence based
  on the marker file, analyse the most recent turn, and return a JSON report
  describing any issues observed.
  
  ## Required JSON Schema
  
  Return an object with the following fields:
  
  ```json
  {
    "branch": "feature/example",
    "marker_timestamp": "2025-10-12T15:21:33Z",
    "summary": "High-level assessment",
    "issues": [
      {
        "id": "lint-tool-missing-black",
        "root_cause": "black missing from .venv",
        "mitigation": "install black",
        "prevention": "add env check",
        "evidence": "make ci lint output"
      }
    ],
    "follow_ups": [
      "Add environment validation step for black",
      "Re-run make ci after installing tooling"
    ]
  }
  ```
  
  - `branch` must match the branch being audited.
  - `marker_timestamp` must equal the timestamp recorded in the marker file.
  - Each issue needs `root_cause`, `mitigation`, `prevention`, and `evidence`.
  - Use the `follow_ups` array to list TODOs that the main agent must carry into
    the branch plan.
  
  ## Analysis Expectations
  
  1. Start from the evidence offset identified in the marker file so earlier turns
     are not re-analysed.
  2. Examine:
     - Commands executed (shell transcript).
     - Changes recorded in plan/progress docs.
     - Test, lint, or format output.
     - Any anomalies, skipped steps, or guardrail violations.
  3. For each issue found, decide whether it is **blocking**. If blocking, note it
     explicitly in the `summary` so the main agent can halt work immediately.
  4. If no issues are detected, return an empty `issues` array and set
     `summary` to “No issues detected.”
  
  The main agent will persist your JSON report verbatim. Do not include narrative
  text outside the JSON payload.

  ## 2025-10-20 14:22:31 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Capture the two uncommitted CLAUDE documentation files on a dedicated feature branch and bring supporting guardrail artifacts up to date.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Reviewed `AGENTS.md` guardrails on 2025-10-20 and seeded session `20251020-20251020142213-4fe453`.
  - Bootstrapped branch `feature/claude-review`, restored the CLAUDE documentation files, and committed them alongside plan/progress updates.
  - Logged top three improvement suggestions from `docs/claude-review.md` into the branch plan for future execution.
  - Captured action item to draft a design document consolidating testing strategy and guardrail improvements.
  - Authored `docs/claude-review-design.md` covering automated testing design, downstream guidance, and guardrail hardening tasks.
  - Expanded downstream guidance to clarify how repo-specific unit/integration suites can hook into guardrail entry points.
  - Clarified the design doc to describe the single existing path-based exemption (merge-only) and the motivation for a shared config.
  - Refined the timeout/recovery section to reflect the current monitor-loop behaviour (threshold breaches exit) and outline automated follow-up actions.
  - Added deliverable manifest gating (applied to every subagent type, including CI audits) so completion depends on verified outputs rather than ad-hoc signals.
  - Noted that once automated recovery is trustworthy, we’ll shrink monitor thresholds to catch completions faster, accepting occasional re-check cycles.
  - Highlighted that the monitor must manage multiple simultaneous subagents and remain active until all registered runs finish.
  - Implemented the first tranche of monitor hardening: per-ID investigations, tmux nudges, manifest-aware JSON telemetry, and continued polling until every subagent completes.
  - Smoke-checked the loop via `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh --iterations 1`; `pytest` unavailable locally (command missing) so broader tests deferred.
  - Tightened default monitor thresholds (interval 30s, log 90s, runtime 240s) to force early-break scenarios during ongoing validation.
  - Codified a reusable monitor scenario harness at `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` that spins up representative subagent behaviours for manual testing today and future automated coverage.
  - Extended the monitor to capture tmux pane snapshots on alerts, giving us transcripts for analysing prompts and improving automated guidance.
  - Updated the manual monitor harness to keep its tmux session visible by default (when already inside tmux), making live observation of subagent panes straightforward.
  - Adjusted the harness layout to match production UX (main pane on the left, subagents stacked in the right half) so manual runs look exactly like real multi-subagent sessions.
  
  ## 2025-10-21 05:01:46 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Validate the synthetic subagent monitor harness end-to-end and confirm the monitor loop closes without manual intervention.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Ran `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` in synthetic mode; observed the `await-prompt` worker stay blocked after the nudge, leaving the monitor loop waiting indefinitely.
  - Confirmed no deliverables were harvested because subagent stubs never exited; no verification/cleanup path exercised.
  - Manually killed lingering tmux panes and removed temporary sandboxes/registry entries to restore a clean baseline for the next session.
  
  **Artifacts**
  - .parallelus/test-monitor-scenario/ (removed after run)
  - docs/agents/subagent-registry.json (synthetic entries pruned)
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Modify the synthetic harness so nudged workers log the response and exit, allowing the monitor to finish without manual cleanup.
  - Re-run the synthetic scenario to ensure panes auto-close and logs reflect the completed runs before implementing the real Codex harness.
  
  **Artifacts**
  - CLAUDE.md
  - docs/claude-review.md
  - docs/plans/feature-claude-review.md
  - docs/progress/feature-claude-review.md
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Monitor for requested revisions or follow-up tasks related to CLAUDE documentation.
  - Scope automated guardrail tooling tests and define approach.
  - Consolidate documentation-only path patterns via shared configuration.
  - Plan timeout and recovery enhancements for subagent management workflow.
  - Draft guardrail design document covering testing strategy and repo adoption guidance.
  - Socialize design document with reviewers and iterate on feedback.
  - Monitor the hardened subagent loop in real scenarios and collect follow-up tuning notes (threshold adjustment, additional nudges).
  - Re-evaluate thresholds after collecting telemetry to ensure they balance responsiveness with noise.
  - Review captured pane snapshots to design smarter, context-aware nudging and potential main-agent handoffs.
  
  ## 2025-10-21 05:06:40 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Unblock the synthetic monitor scenario so nudged workers log activity and exit cleanly, allowing the monitor loop to finish without manual cleanup.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Reviewed `AGENTS.md` on 2025-10-21 before continuing work and initiated session `20251022-20251021050635-41c436`.
  - Confirmed outstanding next steps from the previous run and inspected `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` to understand current nudge handling.
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Implement logging/exit handling for the synthetic `await-prompt` worker when nudged.
  - Re-run the synthetic harness to verify panes close automatically and monitor output reports a successful nudge response.
  
  ## 2025-10-21 05:15:20 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Ensure the synthetic monitor scenario exits cleanly after a nudge by updating worker behaviour and validating the loop.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Updated `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` so the `await-prompt` worker times out safely, logs the received nudge (with timestamp), and exits with success once input arrives; failures now surface if no nudge is delivered.
  - Hardened tmux pane management by replacing the negative index lookup with an explicit last-index calculation to avoid bash array errors in detached sessions.
  - Attempted to run the synthetic harness headlessly via `tmux new-session` and directly within the current tmux session; both runs showed the worker timing out without detecting the injected nudge, indicating further investigation needed into monitor-to-pane signalling in this environment.
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Re-run `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` within an interactive tmux workspace to confirm the nudge path triggers log updates and clean exits (the automated headless runs still timed out).
  - If the nudge continues to miss, instrument `agents-monitor-loop.sh` to capture the pane targets and confirm `send-keys` succeeds during the synthetic scenario.
  
  ## 2025-10-21 05:37:12 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Diagnose why tmux panes linger between synthetic monitor runs and ensure cleanup doesn’t disrupt the user’s workspace.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Began another harness run with additional logging; user observed multiple `await-prompt-fail` panes stacking because KEEP_SESSION left panes open and runs overlapped. Stopped the harness and manually closed panes `%112`, `%118`, `%124` to restore a single active pane.
  - Captured monitor output (`/private/var/folders/.../tmp.QEbfMr6OaF`) and confirmed nudges still don’t register; registry entries continue to miss the pane IDs despite harness debug logging.
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Investigate why `launcher_handle.pane_id` is empty for synthetic entries (verify tmux output handling or string escaping) before rerunning the scenario.
  - Add explicit pane cleanup when KEEP_SESSION=0 completes, so repeated runs don’t accumulate stale panes even if the monitor loop exits abnormally.
  
  ## 2025-10-21 07:10:37 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Stop the runaway harness loops, capture why the monitor still isn’t nudging, and avoid leaving tmux panes behind during debugging.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Added a harness-level timeout (`HARNESS_TIMEOUT`) and optional persistent monitor log path so synthetic runs terminate after a fixed window instead of hanging indefinitely; cleanup now culls panes/sandboxes automatically on timeout.
  - Patched `agents-monitor-loop.sh` table parsing to tolerate prefix markers (`!`, `^`, `?`) and keep the handle column intact, then instrumented the alerts path (`MONITOR_DEBUG=1`) to dump the computed alert sets for inspection.
  - Ran the harness twice with the new timeout (60 s) and confirmed panes were cleaned up automatically; monitor logs now show alerts being detected but the Python helper still emits `IndexError` traces when handling stale cases, so nudges continue to be skipped.
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Fix the `investigate_alerts` Python helper so it handles empty log/runtime fields without raising `IndexError`, then re-run a short synthetic scenario to verify the nudge message appears and the worker logs “received nudge”.
  - Once nudges succeed, drop the temporary debug logging and rerun the full expectation checks to ensure the harness exits cleanly without relying on the timeout safeguard.
  
  ## 2025-10-21 07:44:00 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Stabilise the monitor loop so the synthetic harness exits without human intervention and expectation checks pass.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Patched `agents-monitor-loop.sh` to pass log paths into the Python helper, guard against parsing gaps, join payloads with a non-whitespace separator, and emit debug traces when enabled; the monitor now sends tmux nudges and logs responses without spurious `IndexError`s.
  - Improved `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_scenario.sh` by adding a harness timeout, exposing a persistent monitor log option, adding long-sleep heartbeats, ensuring the `await-prompt` worker records the received nudge, and preventing the fail case from spoofing a positive response; expectation parser now lower-cases events and derives case slugs from run IDs.
  - Re-ran the harness (`HARNESS_TIMEOUT=120`) and confirmed it completes automatically with “Monitor scenario expectations satisfied.”; monitor log (`.parallelus/monitor_log.txt`) shows nudges and expected manual attention outcomes, no panes left behind.
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Strip the temporary `MONITOR_DEBUG` traces from `agents-monitor-loop.sh` once we finish analysis, and keep the harness timeout configurable (defaulting to 60s).
  - Capture these fixes in the branch plan and prep follow-up automation (CI entry point, targeted test) before reverting debug knobs.
  
  ## 2025-10-21 20:31:49 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Capture design notes for a future `HARNESS_MODE=real` so we have a durable reference before implementing it.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Confirmed via `launch_subagent.sh` that real subagents already stream transcripts through `script -qa` into each sandbox’s `subagent.log`; closing the tmux pane terminates the wrapper script and therefore the Codex process.
  - Documented requirements for a real-mode harness: scope limited to purpose-built prompts that mimic synthetic behaviours (sleep, heartbeat, prompt wait); credentials supplied via existing out-of-repo config; results recorded in the branch plan/progress logs pending a formal design addendum.
  - Noted that real mode will be opt-in only (no CI invocation) and depends on the existing monitor cleanup paths; logging/telemetry will reuse the current subagent registry plus monitor snapshots.
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Flesh out the real-mode harness prompts and operator guidance so the new script can be exercised end-to-end, then capture follow-up automation tasks in the branch plan.
  
  ## 2025-10-24 18:17:18 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Implement the real-mode monitor harness and wire it into the test wrapper so future runs exercise the production flow.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Authored `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-real.sh`, which launches deterministic real-mode subagents, drives `make monitor_subagents` with 15/30/300 thresholds, inspects deliverables/transcripts, and force-cleans sandboxes. The script requires `HARNESS_MODE=real` and emits per-scenario summaries.
  - Replaced `tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_real_scenario.sh` with a thin wrapper that simply invokes the production harness, keeping tests and operators on the same path.
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Fill in production-ready prompt language and document the operator workflow (deliverable checks, log review, escalation) before enabling the harness outside ad-hoc runs.

  ## 2025-10-25 12:40:14 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Kick off the real-mode monitor harness validation while complying with guardrails.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Reviewed `AGENTS.md` at session start and launched session `20251023-20251025124002-e6b2c6` via `make start_session` to capture context.
  - Confirmed plan alignment by re-reading `docs/plans/feature-claude-review.md` before executing real-mode test actions.
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Run `HARNESS_MODE=real tests/guardrails/manual_monitor_real_scenario.sh` and document results plus key log excerpts.
  
  ## 2025-10-25 13:04:20 UTC
  **Objectives**
  - Diagnose the stalled real-mode harness run without cleaning up live sandboxes.
  
  **Work Performed**
  - Inspected `docs/agents/subagent-registry.json` to confirm four active real-mode entries plus the earlier synthetic fixtures still marked `running`.
  - Tailed `.parallelus/subagents/sandboxes/real-interactive-success-08lBr0/subagent.log`; observed the monitor-injected `Proceed` text landing in the Codex prompt without being submitted.
  - Ran a single-iteration `make monitor_subagents` (timeout-limited) to capture the monitor’s current view; verified the loop still sees all four real-mode subagents as `running` and is repeatedly nudging them while flagging stale synthetic IDs.
  - Captured pane IDs from `tmux list-panes -a` and sent `C-c` to `%276` (20251025-124253-real-interactive-success) to stop the repeated “89% context left” prompts without closing the pane or cleaning the sandbox.
  - Patched `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-real.sh` to (a) refuse to relaunch scenarios already marked running, (b) record entry metadata, and (c) reconcile each run by harvesting, verifying, and optionally cleaning up via `subagent_manager`.
  - Dry-ran the harness with `HARNESS_MODE=real KEEP_SANDBOX=1` to confirm it now aborts immediately when lingering `real-interactive-success` entries are still marked running; no existing panes were touched.
  - Cleaned up the three stuck real-mode sandboxes by harvesting, forcing cleanup, and closing their tmux panes; noted the sandbox README gap that blocks `verify`.
  - Updated `agents-monitor-loop.sh` so monitor nudges send two `Enter` keystrokes after the message, ensuring the injected “Proceed” actually submits instead of sitting in the compose buffer.
  - Accidental re-run of the harness launched `20251026-143853/143855`; immediately harvested/forced-cleaned those sandboxes and killed panes `%283/%284`.
  - Verified the revised nudge sequence manually: sending `Ctrl+U`, then `Proceed`+`Enter` commits the prompt; codified the same behavior in `agents-monitor-loop.sh` via a `NUDGE_CLEAR` option (enabled by default).
  - Updated `agents-monitor-loop.sh` nudges to send the message with bracketed paste (`ESC [200~ ... ESC [201~`) so the injected command submits in a single pass.
  - Configured subagent launcher to export `CODEX_TUI_RECORD_SESSION=1` and write structured transcripts to `subagent.session.jsonl` inside each sandbox.
  - Added helper scripts `.agents/bin/subagent_tail.sh` (structured log tails) and `.agents/bin/subagent_send_keys.sh` (safe bracketed-paste nudge) and updated the subagent orchestration manual to make parent agents use them.
  - Configured subagent launcher to export `CODEX_TUI_RECORD_SESSION=1` and write structured transcripts to `subagent.session.jsonl` inside each sandbox.
  - With the monitor paused, manually experimented on pane `%282`: observed that `Ctrl+U` alone does not clear existing prompt text; `Ctrl+C` clears the buffer but exits if nothing is pending, so it’s unsafe.
  
  **Next Actions**
  - Explain duplicate `real-interactive-success` launches and capture log tail findings for the maintainer before making any further adjustments.

  # Scenario: interactive-success
  
  You are operating inside a throwaway sandbox. Follow these steps:
  
  1. Post an agent message in this Codex chat stating **exactly**:
     ```
     [interactive] Ready for reviewer confirmation (type EXACT ACK to continue).
     ```
     Do not run any shell commands that simulate user input.
  2. Remain idle until you see a standalone message `ACK` from the main agent. Do **not** type it yourself or automate the reply through a script.
  3. Once you observe the response from the main agent, produce the deliverable by running:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p deliverables
     printf 'interactive-success\n' > deliverables/result.txt
     printf '{"files":["deliverables/result.txt"]}\n' > deliverables/.manifest
     touch deliverables/.complete
     printf '[interactive] deliverable recorded at %s\n' "$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')"
     ```
  4. Leave the shell open so the main agent can harvest/cleanup.
  
  Do not modify other files. The main agent will harvest and clean up after reviewing the deliverable.
