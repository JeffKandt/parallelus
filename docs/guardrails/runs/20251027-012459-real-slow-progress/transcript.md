  # Parallelus Agent Core Guardrails
  
  This document is mandatory reading at the start of every session. Record in the
  branch progress notebook that you reviewed it before running any project
  commands beyond `make read_bootstrap`.
  
  ## 1. Purpose & Usage
  - Internalise these guardrails during Recon & Planning; they apply to every
    turn regardless of scope.
  - Every mitigation must become a durable, versioned artifact that ships with the
    repository (e.g. `.agents` tooling, docs/agents runbooks, automated setup,
    tests/linters). Branch-only notes, local shell hacks, or tribal knowledge are
    not acceptable mitigations.
  - Operational manuals live under `docs/agents/manuals/`. Only consult them when
    a gate below fires. Do **not** pre-emptively open every manual; wait until a
    gate is triggered, then read just the manual(s) required for that task and
    capture the acknowledgement in the progress log before proceeding.
  - Users delegate intent; you own execution, cleanup, and reporting. Never assume
    the user will run shell commands on your behalf.
  - Communicate in terms of outcomes, not implementation details. When the user
    requests an action, acknowledge it, confirm any missing context, and explain
    what you will do. Do not instruct the user to run commands; translate their
    intent into concrete steps you perform and report back in plain language.
  - If the repository provides `.agents/custom/README.md`, read **that file** once
    before deviating from the defaults. Only follow links or manuals it explicitly
    references; do not sweep the rest of `.agents/` unless the custom README tells
    you to. Treat those project notes as extensions layered on top of Parallelus
    core and integrate them alongside the standard guardrails.
  - If this file starts with an **Overlay Notice**, reconcile every `.bak`
    backup created during deployment, merge conflicting instructions into the new
    guardrails, document the outcome in the branch plan, then remove the notice.
  
  ## 2. Session Cadence & Core Checklists
  
  ### Recon & Planning (read-only)
  - Run `make read_bootstrap` immediately; report repo mode, branch, remotes, and
    orphaned notebooks before continuing.
  - Open the active plan and progress notebooks (`docs/plans/<branch>.md`,
    `docs/progress/<branch>.md`) or confirm they do not exist yet.
  - If the tmux environment changed (new machine, updated launcher), reread
    `docs/agents/manuals/tmux-setup.md` before continuing to confirm sockets and
    binaries align with Parallelus expectations.
  - List recent `sessions/` entries. If none match today (2025-10-12), seed a new
    session with `SESSION_PROMPT="..." make start_session` **before** leaving
    Recon & Planning.
  - Inspect repo state, answer questions, plan next moves. Do not edit tracked
    files or run bootstrap helpers during this phase.
  
  ### Transition to Editing (trigger once you intend to modify tracked files)
  1. Ensure the Recon checklist above is complete.
  2. Create or switch to a feature branch via `make bootstrap slug=<slug>`; never
     edit directly on `main`.
  3. Export `SESSION_PROMPT` (optional) and run `make start_session` to capture
     turn context.
  4. Update the branch plan/progress notebooks with current objectives before
     editing code or docs.
  5. Run required environment diagnostics (see Operational Gates for details) and
     log results in the progress notebook.
  6. Commit the bootstrap artifacts once the branch is staged for real work.
    (Bootstrap syncs managed git hooks into `.git/hooks`; do not delete them.)
  
  ### Active Execution & Validation
  - Keep audible alerts active: fire `.agents/bin/agents-alert` **before** any
    approval pause and after each work block (>5 s) before handing control back.
  - Update branch plan/progress notebooks after meaningful work units. Treat
    `➜ checkpoint` markers as mandatory commit points.
  - Expect the managed `pre-commit` hook to remind you about plan/progress updates
    when committing feature work; treat warnings as action items, not noise.
  - Direct commits to the base branch are blocked; set `AGENTS_ALLOW_MAIN_COMMIT=1`
    only for emergencies, and record the rationale in the progress log.
  - When subagents are active, maintain the monitor loop per the Subagent manual.
  - Stay within the requested scope; defer speculative refactors unless directed.
  - Senior architect review is mandatory before merging: capture the signed-off
    report under `docs/reviews/<branch>-<date>.md` (`Reviewed-Branch`,
    `Reviewed-Commit`, `Reviewed-On`, `Decision: approved`, no `Severity:
    Blocker/High`, and acknowledge other findings via
    `AGENTS_MERGE_ACK_REVIEW`). Default profile values live in
    the prompt’s YAML front matter (defaults defined at the top of
    `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/senior_architect.md`).
  - Capture or refresh the senior architect review *after* the final commit on
    the feature branch; if additional commits are required, regenerate the review
    so `Reviewed-Commit` matches `HEAD` before attempting to merge.
  - Launch the senior architect review subagent **only after** staging/committing
    the work under review and pushing it to the feature branch; reviews operate on
    the committed state, not local working tree changes.
  
  ### Turn-End & Session Wrap
  - If a new request arrives after the previous conversation has been idle, run
    `make turn_end m="..."` first to close the earlier turn before starting new
    work.
  - Use `make turn_end m="summary"` to append structured updates before replying
    on an active turn; the helper updates progress logs, plan notebooks, session
    summary, and `meta.json` in one step.
  - Ensure progress logs capture the latest state, session metadata is current,
    and the working tree is either clean or holds only intentional changes noted
    in the progress log. Avoid committing unless the maintainer instructs you to.
  - Do not merge or archive unless the maintainer explicitly asks.
  - Before calling `make turn_end`, launch the Continuous Improvement Auditor prompt (see
    `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/continuous_improvement_auditor.md`) using the previous marker. The
    auditor responds with JSON; save it to
    `docs/self-improvement/reports/<branch>--<marker-timestamp>.json` and carry
    TODOs into the branch plan. Only then run `make turn_end`, which records the
    next marker in `docs/self-improvement/markers/`.
  
  ## 3. Command Quick Reference
  - `make read_bootstrap` – detect repo mode, base branch, branch hygiene.
  - `make bootstrap slug=<slug>` – create/switch feature branch and seed notebooks.
  - `SESSION_PROMPT="..." make start_session` – initialise session artifacts.
  - `make turn_end m="summary"` – checkpoint plan/progress + session meta.
  - `make ci` – run lint, tests, and smoke suite inside the configured adapters.
  
  ## 4. Operational Gates (Read-on-Trigger Manuals)
  - **Subagents:** Before launching or monitoring subagents (e.g.
    `make monitor_subagents`, `subagent_manager ...`), read
    `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` and log the acknowledgement.
  - **Merge / Archive / Remote triage:** Prior to running `make merge`,
    `make archive`, or evaluating unmerged branches, revisit
    `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`. Merge requests now require an approved senior
    architect review staged under `docs/reviews/<branch>-<date>.md` *and* a
    committed retrospective report covering the latest marker; overrides use
    `AGENTS_MERGE_FORCE=1` (and `AGENTS_MERGE_ACK_REVIEW=1` where applicable) and
    must be documented in the progress log.
  - **Environment & Platform diagnostics:** If environment parity is in question
    (CI, Codex Cloud, headless shells), review `docs/agents/runtime-matrix.md` and
    run the diagnostics described there.
  - **Language adapters & integrations:** When enabling or maintaining Python or
    Node tooling—or when Codex integration behaviour changes—consult the manuals
    under `docs/agents/adapters/` and `docs/agents/integrations/`.
  - A directory index lives at `docs/agents/manuals/README.md`; update it when new
    manuals are introduced.
  
  ## 5. Accountability
  - You own final quality. Run the necessary checks, review diffs, and confirm
    guardrails before asking to merge.
  - Record interventions (e.g., subagent halts, environment failures) in the
    progress notebook so reviewers can trace decisions.
  - Leave the workspace in policy-compliant shape at hand-off: clean status or
    documented deltas, updated notebooks, and acknowledged manuals.

  5. Immediately after 'make read_bootstrap', **do not pause**—begin reviewing
     the required docs right away and proceed with the checklist without drafting a
     status message or waiting for confirmation.
  6. Before pausing, audit the branch plan checklist and mark every completed
     task so reviewers see the finished state.
  7. Follow the scope's instructions for merging and cleanup before finishing.
  8. Leave a detailed summary in the progress notebook before exiting.
  9. You already have approval to run commands. After any status update, plan

  # Scenario: slow-progress
  
  This sandbox simulates long-running work without interactive prompts.
  Before launching the workload, complete the standard bootstrap flow:
  
  - Run `make read_bootstrap`.
  - Review `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/custom/README.md` (plus any manuals they
    explicitly call out for this scope).
  - Run `make bootstrap slug=real-slow-progress` so plan/progress notebooks
    exist in the sandbox.
  - Capture guardrail acknowledgements and initial objectives in
    `docs/plans/feature-real-interactive-success.md` and
    `docs/progress/feature-real-interactive-success.md`.
  
  1. Run:
     ```bash
     bash tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/slow_progress.sh
     ```
  2. The script logs progress approximately every 8 seconds and finishes after processing ten items. No deliverables are produced.
  3. Leave the shell open in case the main agent requests additional work.

  You are operating inside sandbox: /Users/jeff/Code/parallelus/.parallelus/subagents/sandboxes/real-slow-progress-qdrCGr
  Scope file: /Users/jeff/Code/parallelus/.parallelus/subagents/sandboxes/real-slow-progress-qdrCGr/SUBAGENT_SCOPE.md
  Sandbox type: throwaway
  Codex profile: default (danger-full-access)
  
  
  1. Read AGENTS.md and all referenced docs.
  2. Review the scope file, then run 'make bootstrap slug=real-slow-progress' to create the
     feature branch.
  3. Convert the scope into plan/progress notebooks and follow all guardrails.
  4. Keep the session open until the entire checklist is complete and 'git status'
     is clean.
  5. Immediately after 'make read_bootstrap', **do not pause**—begin reviewing
     the required docs right away and proceed with the checklist without drafting a
     status message or waiting for confirmation.
  6. Before pausing, audit the branch plan checklist and mark every completed
     task so reviewers see the finished state.
  7. Follow the scope's instructions for merging and cleanup before finishing.
  8. Leave a detailed summary in the progress notebook before exiting.
  9. You already have approval to run commands. After any status update, plan
     outline, or summary, immediately continue with the next checklist item
     without waiting for confirmation.
  10. If you ever feel blocked waiting for a "proceed" or approval, assume the
      answer is "Continue" and move to the next action without prompting the main
      agent.
  ---
  
  Keep working even after 'make read_bootstrap', 'make bootstrap', and the initial
  scope review. Do not pause to summarize or seek confirmation—continue directly
  to the next checklist item.
  Avoid standalone status reports after bootstrap; only document progress in the
  notebooks/checkpoints the checklist calls for.

  # Branch Plan — feature/real-slow-progress
  
  ## Objectives
  - Acknowledge core guardrails and scope-specific instructions for the slow-progress scenario.
  - Run the monitored slow progress script and observe completion without intervention.
  - Maintain compliant documentation (plan, progress log, session artefacts) and leave workspace clean.
  
  ## Checklist
  - [x] Record guardrail reviews and session bootstrap details in progress log.
  - [x] Launch and monitor `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/slow_progress.sh` to completion.
  - [x] Update notebooks with session summary, mark checklist, and confirm clean git status before wrap-up.
  
  ## Next Actions
  - Capture guardrail acknowledgements and session context in `docs/progress/feature-real-slow-progress.md`.
  - Start the slow progress monitoring script in a dedicated shell.
  - Document completion outcomes and cleanliness once monitoring finishes.

  **Objectives**
  - Execute the slow progress monitoring script under branch `feature/real-slow-progress` while adhering to Parallelus guardrails.
  
  -**Work Performed**
  - Reviewed `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/custom/README.md`, and `SUBAGENT_SCOPE.md` immediately after `make read_bootstrap` as required.
  - Ran `make bootstrap slug=real-slow-progress` to create the feature branch and seed plan/progress notebooks.
  - Started session logging with `SESSION_PROMPT="slow progress run" make start_session`; confirmed new entry under `sessions/`.
  - Updated branch plan with objectives, checklist, and next actions aligned to the scope.
  - Executed `bash tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/slow_progress.sh`; observed ten logged progress events ending with successful completion.
  - Extended `.gitignore` to cover sandbox subagent launch artifacts so the working tree can remain clean after future runs.
  - Committed the updated plan/progress notebooks and ignore rules on `feature/real-slow-progress` to maintain a clean working tree.
