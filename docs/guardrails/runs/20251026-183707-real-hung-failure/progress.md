# Branch Progress â€” feature/real-hung-failure

## 2025-10-26 18:42:48 UTC
**Objectives**
- Capture the current waiting state so the main agent can decide the next intervention.

**Work Performed**
- Confirmed the hung failure process (PID 89825) remains active and blocking as designed; background log located at `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/hung_failure.log`.
- Committed plan/progress updates so the branch is ready for hand-off with a clean working tree.

**Artifacts**
- docs/plans/feature-real-hung-failure.md
- docs/progress/feature-real-hung-failure.md

**Next Actions**
- Await main agent instructions to nudge or terminate PID 89825; once cleared, remove `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/hung_failure.log` and record closure.

## 2025-10-26 18:39:47 UTC
**Objectives**
- Confirm the hung failure script behaviour and leave the session waiting for main agent direction.

**Work Performed**
- Launched `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/hung_failure.sh` under `nohup`; captured output in `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/hung_failure.log` and verified the process (PID 89825) is blocking as expected.
- Moved scope/prompt launcher artifacts into the active session directory for preservation while keeping the working tree clean.

**Artifacts**
- tests/guardrails/real_monitor/hung_failure.log

**Next Actions**
- Keep the script running until the main agent decides to intervene; once cleared, clean up logs/background process and finalise branch state.

## 2025-10-26 18:38:08 UTC
**Objectives**
- Validate the hung failure scenario script while maintaining guardrail compliance.

**Work Performed**
- Ran `make read_bootstrap` to confirm repo mode and orphaned notebooks.
- Read `AGENTS.md`, referenced manuals, `.agents/custom/README.md`, and `SUBAGENT_SCOPE.md`.
- Bootstrapped branch `feature/real-hung-failure`, started a session with prompt context, and outlined objectives in the branch plan.

**Artifacts**
- docs/plans/feature-real-hung-failure.md

**Next Actions**
- Execute `tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/hung_failure.sh`, observe the blocking behaviour, and document the outcome.
