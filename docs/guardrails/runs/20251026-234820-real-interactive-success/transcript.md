  # Parallelus Agent Core Guardrails
  
  This document is mandatory reading at the start of every session. Record in the
  branch progress notebook that you reviewed it before running any project
  commands beyond `make read_bootstrap`.
  
  ## 1. Purpose & Usage
  - Internalise these guardrails during Recon & Planning; they apply to every
    turn regardless of scope.
  - Every mitigation must become a durable, versioned artifact that ships with the
    repository (e.g. `.agents` tooling, docs/agents runbooks, automated setup,
    tests/linters). Branch-only notes, local shell hacks, or tribal knowledge are
    not acceptable mitigations.
  - Operational manuals live under `docs/agents/manuals/`. Only consult them when
    a gate below fires. Do **not** pre-emptively open every manual; wait until a
    gate is triggered, then read just the manual(s) required for that task and
    capture the acknowledgement in the progress log before proceeding.
  - Users delegate intent; you own execution, cleanup, and reporting. Never assume
    the user will run shell commands on your behalf.
  - Communicate in terms of outcomes, not implementation details. When the user
    requests an action, acknowledge it, confirm any missing context, and explain
    what you will do. Do not instruct the user to run commands; translate their
    intent into concrete steps you perform and report back in plain language.
  - If the repository provides `.agents/custom/README.md`, read **that file** once
    before deviating from the defaults. Only follow links or manuals it explicitly
    references; do not sweep the rest of `.agents/` unless the custom README tells
    you to. Treat those project notes as extensions layered on top of Parallelus
    core and integrate them alongside the standard guardrails.
  - If this file starts with an **Overlay Notice**, reconcile every `.bak`
    backup created during deployment, merge conflicting instructions into the new
    guardrails, document the outcome in the branch plan, then remove the notice.
  
  ## 2. Session Cadence & Core Checklists
  
  ### Recon & Planning (read-only)
  - Run `make read_bootstrap` immediately; report repo mode, branch, remotes, and
    orphaned notebooks before continuing.
  - Open the active plan and progress notebooks (`docs/plans/<branch>.md`,
    `docs/progress/<branch>.md`) or confirm they do not exist yet.
  - If the tmux environment changed (new machine, updated launcher), reread
    `docs/agents/manuals/tmux-setup.md` before continuing to confirm sockets and
    binaries align with Parallelus expectations.
  - List recent `sessions/` entries. If none match today (2025-10-12), seed a new
    session with `SESSION_PROMPT="..." make start_session` **before** leaving
    Recon & Planning.
  - Inspect repo state, answer questions, plan next moves. Do not edit tracked
    files or run bootstrap helpers during this phase.
  
  ### Transition to Editing (trigger once you intend to modify tracked files)
  1. Ensure the Recon checklist above is complete.
  2. Create or switch to a feature branch via `make bootstrap slug=<slug>`; never
     edit directly on `main`.
  3. Export `SESSION_PROMPT` (optional) and run `make start_session` to capture
     turn context.
  4. Update the branch plan/progress notebooks with current objectives before
     editing code or docs.
  5. Run required environment diagnostics (see Operational Gates for details) and
     log results in the progress notebook.
  6. Commit the bootstrap artifacts once the branch is staged for real work.
    (Bootstrap syncs managed git hooks into `.git/hooks`; do not delete them.)
  
  ### Active Execution & Validation
  - Keep audible alerts active: fire `.agents/bin/agents-alert` **before** any
    approval pause and after each work block (>5 s) before handing control back.
  - Update branch plan/progress notebooks after meaningful work units. Treat
    `➜ checkpoint` markers as mandatory commit points.
  - Expect the managed `pre-commit` hook to remind you about plan/progress updates
    when committing feature work; treat warnings as action items, not noise.
  - Direct commits to the base branch are blocked; set `AGENTS_ALLOW_MAIN_COMMIT=1`
    only for emergencies, and record the rationale in the progress log.
  - When subagents are active, maintain the monitor loop per the Subagent manual.
  - Stay within the requested scope; defer speculative refactors unless directed.
  - Senior architect review is mandatory before merging: capture the signed-off
    report under `docs/reviews/<branch>-<date>.md` (`Reviewed-Branch`,
    `Reviewed-Commit`, `Reviewed-On`, `Decision: approved`, no `Severity:
    Blocker/High`, and acknowledge other findings via
    `AGENTS_MERGE_ACK_REVIEW`). Default profile values live in
    the prompt’s YAML front matter (defaults defined at the top of
    `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/senior_architect.md`).
  - Capture or refresh the senior architect review *after* the final commit on
    the feature branch; if additional commits are required, regenerate the review
    so `Reviewed-Commit` matches `HEAD` before attempting to merge.
  - Launch the senior architect review subagent **only after** staging/committing
    the work under review and pushing it to the feature branch; reviews operate on
    the committed state, not local working tree changes.
  
  ### Turn-End & Session Wrap
  - If a new request arrives after the previous conversation has been idle, run
    `make turn_end m="..."` first to close the earlier turn before starting new
    work.
  - Use `make turn_end m="summary"` to append structured updates before replying
    on an active turn; the helper updates progress logs, plan notebooks, session
    summary, and `meta.json` in one step.
  - Ensure progress logs capture the latest state, session metadata is current,
    and the working tree is either clean or holds only intentional changes noted
    in the progress log. Avoid committing unless the maintainer instructs you to.
  - Do not merge or archive unless the maintainer explicitly asks.
  - Before calling `make turn_end`, launch the Continuous Improvement Auditor prompt (see
    `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/continuous_improvement_auditor.md`) using the previous marker. The
    auditor responds with JSON; save it to
    `docs/self-improvement/reports/<branch>--<marker-timestamp>.json` and carry
    TODOs into the branch plan. Only then run `make turn_end`, which records the
    next marker in `docs/self-improvement/markers/`.
  
  ## 3. Command Quick Reference
  - `make read_bootstrap` – detect repo mode, base branch, branch hygiene.
  - `make bootstrap slug=<slug>` – create/switch feature branch and seed notebooks.
  - `SESSION_PROMPT="..." make start_session` – initialise session artifacts.
  - `make turn_end m="summary"` – checkpoint plan/progress + session meta.
  - `make ci` – run lint, tests, and smoke suite inside the configured adapters.
  
  ## 4. Operational Gates (Read-on-Trigger Manuals)
  - **Subagents:** Before launching or monitoring subagents (e.g.
    `make monitor_subagents`, `subagent_manager ...`), read
    `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` and log the acknowledgement.
  - **Merge / Archive / Remote triage:** Prior to running `make merge`,
    `make archive`, or evaluating unmerged branches, revisit
    `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`. Merge requests now require an approved senior
    architect review staged under `docs/reviews/<branch>-<date>.md` *and* a
    committed retrospective report covering the latest marker; overrides use
    `AGENTS_MERGE_FORCE=1` (and `AGENTS_MERGE_ACK_REVIEW=1` where applicable) and
    must be documented in the progress log.
  - **Environment & Platform diagnostics:** If environment parity is in question
    (CI, Codex Cloud, headless shells), review `docs/agents/runtime-matrix.md` and
    run the diagnostics described there.
  - **Language adapters & integrations:** When enabling or maintaining Python or
    Node tooling—or when Codex integration behaviour changes—consult the manuals
    under `docs/agents/adapters/` and `docs/agents/integrations/`.
  - A directory index lives at `docs/agents/manuals/README.md`; update it when new
    manuals are introduced.
  
  ## 5. Accountability
  - You own final quality. Run the necessary checks, review diffs, and confirm
    guardrails before asking to merge.
  - Record interventions (e.g., subagent halts, environment failures) in the
    progress notebook so reviewers can trace decisions.
  - Leave the workspace in policy-compliant shape at hand-off: clean status or
    documented deltas, updated notebooks, and acknowledged manuals.

  5. Immediately after 'make read_bootstrap', **do not pause**—begin reviewing
     the required docs right away and proceed with the checklist without drafting a
     status message or waiting for confirmation.
  6. Before pausing, audit the branch plan checklist and mark every completed
     task so reviewers see the finished state.
  7. Follow the scope's instructions for merging and cleanup before finishing.
  8. Leave a detailed summary in the progress notebook before exiting.
  9. You already have approval to run commands. After any status update, plan

  # Scenario: interactive-success
  
  You are operating inside a throwaway sandbox. Follow these steps:
  
  1. Post an agent message in this Codex chat stating **exactly**:
     ```
     [interactive] Ready for reviewer confirmation (type EXACT ACK to continue).
     ```
     Do not run any shell commands that simulate user input.
  2. Remain idle until you see a standalone message `ACK` from the main agent. Do **not** type it yourself or automate the reply through a script.
  3. After you observe the response from the main agent, run:
     ```bash
     tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/interactive_success.sh
     ```
     This helper emits 60 seconds of heartbeats while waiting, creates the
     deliverable bundle, then emits another 60 seconds of heartbeats before
     signalling readiness. It writes the files to `deliverables/` on your behalf.
  4. Leave the shell open so the main agent can harvest/cleanup.
  
  Do not modify other files. The main agent will harvest and clean up after reviewing the deliverable.
