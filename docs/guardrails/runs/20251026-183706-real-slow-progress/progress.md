# Branch Progress â€” feature/real-slow-progress

## 2025-10-26 18:38:25 UTC
**Objectives**
- Execute the slow-progress sandbox script while maintaining full guardrail compliance and documentation.

**Work Performed**
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` and referenced manuals (`docs/agents/manuals/README.md`, `docs/agents/manuals/tmux-setup.md`, `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/senior_architect.md`, `.agents/prompts/agent_roles/continuous_improvement_auditor.md`, `.agents/custom/README.md`) prior to continuing beyond the bootstrap command.
- Inspected `SUBAGENT_SCOPE.md`, ran `make bootstrap slug=real-slow-progress`, and started session `20251026-143832-20251026183832-d4af5e` with contextual prompt.
- Converted scope requirements into branch plan structure and recorded initial checklist items.

**Artifacts**
- docs/plans/feature-real-slow-progress.md
- docs/progress/feature-real-slow-progress.md

**Next Actions**
- Run `bash tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/slow_progress.sh` and monitor until it completes all ten items.
- Log script results and checklist status in notebooks, run `.agents/bin/agents-alert` before final handoff, and confirm `git status` is clean.

**Objectives**
- Capture execution results from the slow-progress scenario and wrap session tasks.

**Work Performed**
- Ran `bash tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/slow_progress.sh`; observed ten progress updates over ~80 seconds with final completion message and no deliverables generated.

**Artifacts**
- (none; script logs only)

**Next Actions**
- Update plan checklist and final progress summary, run `.agents/bin/agents-alert`, verify `git status` is clean, and document closing notes per scope.

## 2025-10-26 18:41:45 UTC
**Objectives**
- Close out documentation, satisfy guardrail checklist, and prepare a clean branch handoff.

**Work Performed**
- Fired `.agents/bin/agents-alert` after completing the long-running script, removed sandbox prompt/scope helpers, and prepared plan checklist updates prior to final audit.

**Artifacts**
- (none; cleanup only)

**Next Actions**
- Mark remaining plan checklist item once clean status is confirmed, stage plan/progress notebooks, commit the session updates, and verify `git status` reports a clean tree.

## 2025-10-26 18:42:55 UTC
**Objectives**
- Confirm branch hygiene and document final state for reviewers.

**Work Performed**
- Checked off the remaining plan checklist item, staged and committed the plan/progress notebooks (`Add plan and progress logs for slow progress scenario`), and verified `git status -sb` reports a clean tree on `feature/real-slow-progress`.

**Artifacts**
- docs/progress/feature-real-slow-progress.md (updated summary)
- docs/plans/feature-real-slow-progress.md (checklist audited)

**Next Actions**
- None; scope complete pending final report to main agent.
