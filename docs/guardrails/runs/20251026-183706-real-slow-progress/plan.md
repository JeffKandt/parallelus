# Branch Plan â€” feature/real-slow-progress

## Objectives
- Follow the slow-progress sandbox scope by running the monitoring script to completion.
- Maintain guardrail compliance with updated plan/progress logs and clean workspace state.
- Capture outcomes and next steps in notebooks for reviewer transparency.

## Checklist
- [x] Read `AGENTS.md` plus referenced manuals (`docs/agents/manuals/README.md`, `.../tmux-setup.md`, `senior_architect.md`, `continuous_improvement_auditor.md`, `.agents/custom/README.md`).
- [x] Review `SUBAGENT_SCOPE.md` and bootstrap branch `feature/real-slow-progress`.
- [x] Start session with `SESSION_PROMPT` and note guardrail review in progress log.
- [x] Execute `bash tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/slow_progress.sh` and monitor until completion.
- [x] Update progress notebook with detailed summary and checklist audit; ensure `git status` clean.
- [x] Run `.agents/bin/agents-alert` before final handoff per guardrail reminder.

## Next Actions
- Capture guardrail acknowledgements and initial state in the progress notebook.
- Prepare to launch the slow_progress script once logging updates are in place.
