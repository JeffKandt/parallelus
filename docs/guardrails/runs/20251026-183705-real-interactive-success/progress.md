# Branch Progress — feature/real-interactive-success

## 2025-10-26 18:38:23 UTC
**Objectives**
- Verify the interactive success monitor flow per scope while following guardrails.

**Work Performed**
- Ran `make read_bootstrap` to capture repo state.
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md`, required manuals (`docs/agents/...`), and `.agents/custom/README.md`; recorded acknowledgement here before proceeding.
- Read `SUBAGENT_SCOPE.md`, ran `make bootstrap slug=real-interactive-success`, and drafted the branch plan derived from the scope.
- Started session logging via `SESSION_PROMPT="Run interactive success monitor" make start_session`.
- Executed `bash tests/guardrails/real_monitor/scripts/interactive_success.sh`, monitored heartbeats, and responded with `ACK` once prompted; confirmed deliverable recorded.
- Verified `deliverables/result.txt` contains `interactive-success` per manifest.
- Added harness helper artifacts to `.git/info/exclude` so they stay untracked while preserving the deliverable for review.
- Committed scope, deliverable artifacts, and notebook updates (`chore: record interactive success run`) to document the session with a clean working tree.

**Artifacts**
- docs/plans/feature-real-interactive-success.md
- docs/progress/feature-real-interactive-success.md
- deliverables/

**Next Actions**
- None — deliverable captured under `deliverables/`, branch clean, awaiting maintainer harvest.
