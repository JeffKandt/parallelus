## Summary
- Monitor loop now handles nudge-helper failures without aborting, keeping manual-attention guidance and evidence available to operators.

## Findings
- Severity: Info | Area: Monitor Loop | Summary: Confirmed `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh` traps `subagent_send_keys` failures, emits the manual-attention warning, and captures failure snapshots while staying alive under `set -euo pipefail`.
  - Evidence: Reviewed `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh#L200-L245` on commit `d886dfa` and observed the guarded `SEND_KEYS_CMD` invocation plus the new `nudge-failure` snapshot stage.
  - Recommendation: None; retain the snapshot stage for post-incident analysis.
- Severity: Info | Area: Monitor Tests | Summary: New regression test covers the nudge-failure path with deterministic stubs for tmux, send-keys, and registry metadata.
  - Evidence: Inspected `.agents/tests/monitor_loop.py#L90-L277`, noting the `nudge-failure` fixture and `test_nudge_helper_failure_reports_manual_attention`.
  - Recommendation: Consider sharing the registry stub helper across future monitor scenarios to keep fixtures consistent.

## Tests & Evidence Reviewed
- `python3 -m pytest .agents/tests/monitor_loop.py -q`
- Manual diff review of `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh`.
- Plan/progress updates at `docs/plans/feature-claude-review.md` and `docs/progress/feature-claude-review.md`.
