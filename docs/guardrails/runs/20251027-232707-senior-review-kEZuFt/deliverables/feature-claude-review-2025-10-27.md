## Summary
- Monitor loop regression forces an immediate exit on nudge failures, so manual-attention flows are no longer observable.

## Findings
- Severity: Blocker | Area: Monitor Loop | Summary: `set -e` now aborts the loop before emitting manual-attention guidance when `subagent_send_keys` fails.
  - Evidence: `.agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh#L216` invokes the nudge helper without guarding the exit status; with `set -euo pipefail` this terminates the script on non-zero returns. Reproduced by stubbing `subagent_send_keys.sh` to exit 1 and running `MONITOR_NUDGE_MESSAGE=test MONITOR_RECHECK_DELAY=0 MONITOR_NUDGE_DELAY=0 .agents/bin/agents-monitor-loop.sh --interval 0 --iterations 1`, which exits immediately after printing the nudge message.
  - Recommendation: Restore defensive error handling (e.g. wrap the helper in `if ! ...; then` or append `|| true`) so the loop can report the failure, capture snapshots, and continue prompting for manual intervention.
- Severity: Medium | Area: Monitor Tests | Summary: No regression test covers the nudge-failure path, so the blocker slipped past `.agents/tests/monitor_loop.py`.
  - Evidence: The test suite only stubs `subagent_manager.sh` outputs; it never exercises the tmux/nudge flow or a failing send-keys helper, so the exit-on-error regression remains undetected.
  - Recommendation: Extend the smoke test (or add a new case) that injects a failing `subagent_send_keys.sh` to assert the loop reports the failure instead of terminating.

## Tests & Evidence Reviewed
- `make read_bootstrap`
- Manual simulation of monitor nudge failure (temporary repo with stub helpers as described above)
- Review of `docs/guardrails/runs/20251027-194902-real-interactive-success/` artifacts for completeness

## Follow-Ups / Tickets
- [ ] Add regression coverage for nudge-helper failure handling once the guard is restored.
