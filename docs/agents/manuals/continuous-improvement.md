# Continuous Improvement Playbook

Continuous improvement is the heartbeat of Parallelus. When the agent falls short, pause immediately, capture what happened, and drive a fix that ensures the issue never recurs.

## Investigation Discipline
- **Stop the line.** When behaviour diverges from expectations (missed guardrail, incorrect output, user confusion), halt new work and investigate.
- **Document evidence.** Save logs, notebook entries, and transcripts in the branch progress file so the context is preserved.
- **Root cause over symptoms.** Ask "why" repeatedly until you understand the systemic gap (missing check, unclear instruction, tool limitation, human-agent misunderstanding).

## Durable Mitigations
- Add or update automated guardrails (scripts, hooks, prompts) rather than relying on memory or progress-log notes.
- If the fix is specific to a downstream project, capture it in that project's sidecar config (e.g., `.agents/custom/`, project-specific manuals) so Parallelus updates can be applied without merge conflicts.
- If the mitigation generalises to the Parallelus core, upstream it promptly (open an issue/PR against the Parallelus repository you pulled the process from) and remove the downstream override once the change lands.
- When introducing configuration knobs or optional behaviour, keep defaults aligned with Parallelus best practices and document how operators can opt in/out safely.

## Feedback Loop
1. Log the incident in the progress notebook with a `âžœ checkpoint` marker.
2. Implement the mitigation (code, doc, test) on the feature branch.
3. Update this playbook if the incident reveals a new class of risk or mitigation pattern.
4. Surface learnings in `docs/PLAN.md` so future work prioritises system-level resilience.

## Metrics to Watch
- Frequency and severity of retrospective findings that repeat past issues.
- Time from issue detection to permanent mitigation.
- Adoption rate of new guardrails across downstream projects.

Treat every unexpected behaviour as an opportunity to harden the system. The bar is "fix it once, fix it forever." Capture the durable artifact (code, doc, test, tooling) immediately so future deployments inherit the fix by default.
