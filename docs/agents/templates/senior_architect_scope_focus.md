# Senior Architect Review Scope â€” feature/publish-repo (focused delta)

## Context
- **Branch:** feature/publish-repo
- **Commit under review:** $(git rev-parse HEAD)
- **Remote check:** ensure the commit exists on origin/feature/publish-repo before review begins.
- **Focus:** Only two documentation updates landed after the last approval:
  1. `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` now mandates launching the monitor loop via `make monitor_subagents`.
  2. `docs/progress/feature-publish-repo.md` records the guardrail acknowledgement.
  Everything else matches commit d1c0ec21a4dea7583752326f13bfbb30b11f44f3.

## Preconditions
- Working tree is clean and matches the pushed commit.
- CI (`make ci`) has passed on this commit.
- No additional changes will be introduced until the review is complete.

## Objectives
- [ ] Confirm the documentation change in `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md` accurately reflects the required `make monitor_subagents` workflow.
- [ ] Verify the progress log update mirrors the guardrail change and references the correct timestamp (2025-10-16 15:36:42 UTC).
- [ ] Spot-check prior high-risk areas only if something unexpected appears in the diff; otherwise, carry forward the previous approval context.

## Key Artifacts
- `docs/agents/subagent-session-orchestration.md`
- `docs/progress/feature-publish-repo.md`
- `docs/plans/feature-publish-repo.md`
- Previous review: `docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md`

## Review Deliverable
- Update `docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md` with the new commit hash and decision.
- Call out any issues found in the focused diff (or explicitly note "no findings").
