# Senior Architect Review Scope â€” feature/publish-repo (focused delta)

## Context
- **Branch:** feature/publish-repo
- **Commit under review:** $(git rev-parse HEAD)
- **Remote check:** ensure the commit exists on origin/feature/publish-repo before review begins.
- **Focus:** Changes since the last approved commit (`db67706404e69a312a671f65fc8d62b2e162925d`) are limited to:
  1. Guardrail documentation/log updates describing the required `make monitor_subagents` workflow.
  2. Merge-time enforcement in `.agents/bin/agents-merge` and `.agents/hooks/pre-merge-commit` that blocks lingering review notebooks.
  3. Supporting plan/progress and git-workflow documentation updates, including folding branch notebooks into the canonical `docs/PLAN.md` / `docs/PROGRESS.md` records.
  No other files have changed.

## Preconditions
- Working tree is clean and matches the pushed commit.
- CI (`make ci`) has passed on this commit.
- No additional changes will be introduced until the review is complete.

## Objectives
- [ ] Confirm the documentation changes (subagent manual, git workflow, plan/progress notes) accurately describe the new guardrail.
- [ ] Review the merge-time enforcement updates in `.agents/bin/agents-merge` and `.agents/hooks/pre-merge-commit`.
- [ ] Spot-check prior high-risk areas only if additional diffs appear; otherwise, rely on the previous approval context.

## Key Artifacts
- `.agents/bin/agents-merge`
- `.agents/hooks/pre-merge-commit`
- `docs/agents/manuals/subagent-session-orchestration.md`
- `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`
- `docs/PLAN.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`
- Previous review: `docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md`

## Review Deliverable
- Update `docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md` with the new commit hash and decision.
- Call out any issues found in the focused diff (or explicitly note "no findings").
