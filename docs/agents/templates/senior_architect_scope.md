# Senior Architect Review Scope â€” feature/publish-repo

## Context
- **Branch:** feature/publish-repo
- **Commit under review:** $(git rev-parse HEAD)
- **Remote check:** ensure the commit exists on origin/feature-publish-repo before review begins.
- **Focus:** Guardrail updates for tmux overlays, subagent orchestration, CI audit process, transcript capture commitments, and lint/test toolchain setup.

## Preconditions
- Working tree is clean and matches the pushed commit.
- CI (`make ci`) has passed on this commit.
- No additional changes will be introduced until the review is complete.

## Objectives
- [ ] Review code and docs between the base commit (origin/main) and the commit hash above.
- [ ] Validate tmux status overlay behaviour and socket-aware bootstrap changes.
- [ ] Assess subagent orchestration updates (role normalization, CI audit scope template, transcript capture requirements).
- [ ] Confirm Python lint/test toolchain additions (`requirements.txt`, `.agents/adapters/python/env.sh`) and `make ci` readiness.
- [ ] Inspect progress/plan updates for alignment with guardrail expectations and transcript stewardship.

## Key Artifacts
- `.agents/make/agents.mk`, `.agents/tmux/parallelus-status.tmux`, `.agents/bin/subagent_prompt_phase.py`

## Review Deliverable
- Produce `docs/reviews/feature-publish-repo-2025-10-13.md` with:
  - `Reviewed-Branch`, `Reviewed-Commit`, `Reviewed-On`, `Decision`.
  - Severity-classified findings with evidence and remediation notes.
  - Summary and follow-up recommendations.
