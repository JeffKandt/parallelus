# Senior Architect Review Scope â€” feature/publish-repo

## Context
- **Branch:** feature/publish-repo
- **Base commit:** 9554bf0862ae777458d5ac22f16f1ea2b3fde61b (origin/main)
- **Head commit:** (current working tree; include uncommitted changes in assessment)
- **Focus:** Guardrail updates for tmux overlays, subagent orchestration, CI audit process, and lint/test toolchain setup.

## Objectives
- [ ] Review code and documentation diffs between the base commit and the current working tree.
- [ ] Validate the new tmux status overlay behaviour and socket-aware bootstrap changes.
- [ ] Assess subagent orchestration updates (role normalization, CI audit scope template, transcript capture requirements).
- [ ] Confirm Python lint/test toolchain additions (`requirements.txt`, `.agents/adapters/python/env.sh`) and `make ci` readiness.
- [ ] Inspect progress/plan updates for alignment with guardrail expectations.
