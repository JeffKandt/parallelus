# Context Capsule Prompt Template

Use this template when generating a context capsule prior to launching a
subagent. Replace bracketed sections with project-specific details. Keep the
final length under the configured token budget (default 1.2k tokens). Cite plan
entries, progress logs, or commits whenever referencing historical work.

Run `make capsule_prompt` to print a ready-to-send instruction block that
includes this template, current branch metadata, and outstanding reminders. The
helper can also create a stub file with `stub=1` before you fill in the
sections below. Add `plan_slug=<slug>` if your plan/progress notebooks use a
different naming convention than the current branch.
