  Scope file: /Users/jeff/Code/parallelus/.parallelus/

  Sandbox type: throwaway
  Codex profile: default (danger-full-access)
  Role overrides:
   - Additional constraints: "Read-only; respond with JSON
  only."\n


  1. Read AGENTS.md and docs/prompts/agent_roles/
  continuous_improvement_auditor.md to confirm guardrails.
  2. Review docs/self-improvement/markers/feature-publish-
  repo.json to capture the marker timestamp and referenced
  plan/progress files for feature/publish-repo.
  3. Gather evidence without modifying the workspace:
  inspect git status, git diff, notebooks, and recent
  command output that reflect the current state of feature/
  publish-repo.
  4. Emit a JSON object matching the auditor schema (branch,
  marker_timestamp, summary, issues[], follow_ups[]).
  Reference concrete evidence for every issue; if no issues
  exist, return an empty issues array.
  5. Stay read-only—do not run make bootstrap or alter
  files. Print the JSON report and exit.

  # Role-specific guidance

  # Retrospective Auditor Prompt

  Operate strictly read-only. Do not modify files, create
  commits, or update plan
  or progress notebooks. Your single responsibility is to
  gather evidence based
  on the marker file, analyse the most recent turn, and
  return a JSON report
  describing any issues observed.

  ## Required JSON Schema

  Return an object with the following fields:

  ```json
  {
    "branch": "feature/example",
    "marker_timestamp": "2025-10-12T15:21:33Z",
    "summary": "High-level assessment",
    "issues": [
      {
        "id": "lint-tool-missing-black",
        "root_cause": "black missing from .venv",
        "mitigation": "install black",
        "prevention": "add env check",
        "evidence": "make ci lint output"
      }
    ],
    "follow_ups": [
      "Add environment validation step for black",
      "Re-run make ci after installing tooling"
    ]
  }
  ```

  - `branch` must match the branch being audited.
  - `marker_timestamp` must equal the timestamp recorded in
  the marker file.
  - Each issue needs `root_cause`, `mitigation`,
  `prevention`, and `evidence`.
  - Use the `follow_ups` array to list TODOs that the main
  agent must carry into
    the branch plan.

  ## Analysis Expectations

  1. Start from the evidence offset identified in the marker
  file so earlier turns
     are not re-analysed.
  2. Examine:
     - Commands executed (shell transcript).
     - Changes recorded in plan/progress docs.
     - Test, lint, or format output.
     - Any anomalies, skipped steps, or guardrail
  violations.
  3. For each issue found, decide whether it is
  **blocking**. If blocking, note it
     explicitly in the `summary` so the main agent can halt
  work immediately.
  4. If no issues are detected, return an empty `issues`
  array and set
     `summary` to “No issues detected.”

  The main agent will persist your JSON report verbatim. Do
  not include narrative
  text outside the JSON payload.

• I’m examining progress entries after the marker timestamp
  to focus on recent work for the continuous improvement
  audit. I want to ensure I’m analyzing the latest turn
  beyond the marker’s time so earlier turns aren’t revisited
  unnecessarily. I’ll look for the most up-to-date report to
  gather relevant evidence.

• I'm going through audit details to verify if reported
  progress matches actual code changes and plan updates,
  paying close attention to guardrail compliance like
  manual acknowledgments, workspace cleanliness, and testing
  records. There’s a lot to check, including whether follow-
  ups were properly added and executed, if new tasks are
  documented, and if cleanup steps happen after runs,
  especially regarding the .parallelus/ folder and markers
  in progress logs. I'll also scrutinize recent diffs
  and logs to confirm no lingering “running” states or
  uncommitted changes remain.

  see if everything aligns with the recorded audit entries.

• I'm carefully examining the audit and progress logs to
  identify any guardrail issues or missing plan updates,
  especially around tmux changes, subagent runs, and
  documentation follow-ups. There’s a focus on validating
  timestamps, consistency of plan and progress entries, and
  whether new Next Actions from recent progress are fully
  reflected in the plan. I want to be sure any outstanding
  tasks or inconsistencies are flagged accurately.

• I’m reviewing git status and recent progress entries to
  confirm no unresolved issues remain, while identifying

  and observing new indicators; I’ll ensure the summary
  distinguishes resolved issues from ongoing action items
  and references relevant evidence from the repo.

• I'll create a JSON summary capturing no issues detected,
  detail recent work on tmux overlay and socket support,
  CI audit scope, and manual acknowledgment logging, citing
  evidence with file and line references. Then I’ll add
  two follow-up entries about adding plan tasks to confirm
  tmux overlay layout and observe a new worktree indicator,
  ensuring these items are clearly distinguished from
  existing plan actions. Finally, I’ll set branch and marker
  timestamps accordingly before outputting.
