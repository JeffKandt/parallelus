      "id": "ci-auditor-timeout-aborted",
      "root_cause": "The CI-auditor throwaway subagent (id 20260207-191010-ci-audit) stopped producing new log output and exceeded interactive runtime expectations.",
      "mitigation": "Abort and clean the stalled subagent, preserve logs for evidence, and continue with marker-aligned retrospective report publication.",
      "prevention": "Keep the CI-auditor timeout/abort guard enabled and add a preflight to constrain evidence scope when historical logs are large.",
      "evidence": "Subagent status remained running with stale log age (`.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh status --id 20260207-191010-ci-audit`), then was aborted/cleaned via `.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh abort --id 20260207-191010-ci-audit --reason timeout` and `.agents/bin/subagent_manager.sh cleanup --id 20260207-191010-ci-audit --force`; run log captured at `/tmp/ci-audit-20260207-191010.log`."
