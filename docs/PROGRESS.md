**Branch:** feature/process-review-gate

- Implemented synchronous retrospective workflow with enforced audit-before-turn_end gating.
- Persisted senior architect defaults and captured approval (feature-process-review-gate-20251012.md).
- Strengthened merge/deploy guardrails and removed unused Swift demo targets.
- make ci passing; branch ready for merge into main.

## 2025-10-16
**Branch:** feature/publish-repo

- Published the repository to GitHub and expanded documentation (guardrails, tmux workflow, subagent orchestration, README).
- Enhanced subagent tooling: profile support, deliverable harvesting, CI auditor scopes, monitor-loop fixes, clean-worktree enforcement, and tmux socket awareness.
- Captured continuous improvement audits, plan/progress updates, and transcript requirements; consolidated senior architect review artefacts and transcripts.
- Introduced strict merge guardrails that block lingering branch notebooks; documented the `make monitor_subagents` supervision requirement and updated merge workflow guidance.
- Obtained senior architect approval for commit 5a8d10f7e04f596c71708db761d3088b1a9a9e67, with remaining follow-ups logged in the main plan.
